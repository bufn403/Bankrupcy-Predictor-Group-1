Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears pessimistic due to the extensive impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations. For example, the filing states, "The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic and has spread to multiple global regions. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses around the world."

Step 2: Relevant figures provided in the discussion include a significant decrease in total revenues for both the U.S. RAC and International RAC segments. For instance, "Total revenues decreased $138 million, or 9%, for the U.S. RAC segment in 1Q 2020 versus 1Q 2019." Additionally, there is a material reduction in commitments to purchase vehicles and a challenging vehicle resale market, indicating financial strain.

Step 3: The conditions presented suggest a failed quarter with substantial decreases in revenue and adverse impacts on operations due to COVID-19. Furthermore, the uncertain duration and magnitude of the pandemic's impact imply that conditions may not improve in the near term.

Step 4: Considering the pessimistic sentiment, significant revenue declines, and ongoing challenges such as reduced commitments for vehicle purchases and a challenging resale market, the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite aggressive cost management efforts, the uncertain duration of the pandemic and its potential to further deteriorate the used-vehicle market pose significant financial threats to the company's sustainability.
