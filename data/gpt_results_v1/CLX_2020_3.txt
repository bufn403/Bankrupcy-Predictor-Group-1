Step 1: The sentiment expressed in the management's discussion appears cautiously optimistic. While they acknowledge the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they also express confidence in their ability to navigate the crisis and position the company for long-term growth, stating, "we believe that the actions we are taking will help us emerge from this global pandemic operationally sound, and well positioned for continued long-term growth."

Step 2: Looking at the financial figures provided, we observe a significant increase in net sales of 27% for both the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year periods. This growth is attributed to increased demand for disinfecting cleaning products due to the pandemic. Additionally, there is an improvement in gross margin by 130 and 270 basis points for the three and six month periods, respectively, driven by higher volume and cost savings.

Step 3: The consistent increase in net sales and gross margin percentages signifies a successful quarter. The higher sales volume and improved margins indicate that the company is meeting increased demand effectively and managing costs efficiently. Furthermore, the company's ability to adapt to changing consumer behaviors during the pandemic showcases resilience in adverse conditions.

Based on the cautiously optimistic sentiment, significant increase in net sales, and improved gross margins indicating successful operations during a challenging period, the company is deemed to have a low risk of bankruptcy.
