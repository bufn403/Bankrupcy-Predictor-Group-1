Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While there are mentions of challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are also statements showing resilience and strategic responses to the situation. For example, "In response to the pandemicâ€™s impacts to our business, we implemented cost avoidance initiatives in the first half of 2020" shows proactive measures being taken.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets ratio indicates potential liquidity issues, which can be a sign of financial distress.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A high ratio indicates the company is effectively reinvesting profits back into the business, which is a positive sign when considering financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): A moderate ratio, indicating the company's ability to generate earnings relative to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A high ratio indicates efficient asset utilization to generate revenue.

Step 3: When combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the pandemic, as seen in statements like, "we have seen negative impacts to all of our segments with Conferences being the most impacted." However, the company is also taking strategic actions to mitigate these challenges, such as implementing cost-saving measures and focusing on client engagement.

Step 4: The company exhibits a mix of positive and challenging aspects in its management discussion and financial ratios. While there are signs of resilience and proactive measures, there are also indications of impact from the pandemic. Therefore, the overall assessment leans towards a medium risk of bankruptcy, considering both the strengths and challenges faced by the company.
