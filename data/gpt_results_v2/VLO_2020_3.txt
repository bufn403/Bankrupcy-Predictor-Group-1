High risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment conveyed in the management's discussion is pessimistic. The company highlights the significant economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to reduced demand, lower prices, and negative impacts on their business.

Step 2: The discussion mentions significant decreases in the prices of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel, indicating a challenging market environment. For example, the price of gasoline fell by 74% at the end of March and only partially recovered by the end of September.

Step 3: The company reported an operating loss of $621 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributed to lower operating income across its segments. Despite some improvements in product demand and prices, uncertainties related to COVID-19 and political events like Brexit could continue to affect their operations negatively.

Based on the significant decrease in revenues, operating income, and challenging market conditions highlighted in the filing, the company shows signs of financial distress and a high risk of bankruptcy in the future.
