Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of caution and optimism. While the company acknowledges the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, it also highlights potential opportunities for growth in various sectors. One quote supporting this is: "In the long-term, we believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available."

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
   - Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The negative value of -0.030 suggests that the company has more liabilities than assets in the short term, indicating potential liquidity issues.
   - Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.569, this ratio shows a good proportion of retained earnings to total assets, indicating the company's ability to generate profits and reinvest in the business.
   - EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The value of 0.109 indicates that the company's earnings before interest and taxes relative to total assets are at a moderate level.
   - Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A high value of 0.636 suggests that the company is generating significant revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining text analysis with financial ratios:
   - The company faces challenges due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business segments, especially in the aerospace industry.
   - Despite cost-cutting measures and strategic investments, the company's overall sales have decreased, particularly in the Aerospace Systems Segment.

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mix of financial ratios, and the challenging conditions highlighted in the text, the company is classified as having a Medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The negative working capital to total assets ratio and the challenges faced by the company due to the pandemic contribute to this assessment. 

By evaluating the financial ratios in conjunction with the context provided in the management discussion, it is evident that while the company has strengths such as retained earnings and revenue generation, the current challenges and uncertainties impact its overall risk profile.
