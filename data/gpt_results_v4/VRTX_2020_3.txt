Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is optimistic and focused on the company's efforts to invest in scientific innovation to develop transformative medicines for severe diseases. The company highlights successful product approvals like TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO for cystic fibrosis, as well as positive clinical trial results. However, the discussion also acknowledges challenges in obtaining reimbursement for some medicines in certain markets due to complexities in healthcare reimbursement systems.

Step 2:
- Expansion into Additional Disease Areas: The company is focused on broadening its pipeline beyond cystic fibrosis, with efforts in genetic therapies for diseases like sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, as well as treatments for pain and kidney diseases.
- Revenue Growth: In the third quarter of 2020, net product revenues continued to increase due to the approval of TRIKAFTA and uptake of medicines in international markets following reimbursement agreements.
- R&D and SG&A Expenses: While expenses decreased in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the previous year, cost of sales remained at 12% of net product revenues.

Step 3: The company has experienced revenue growth due to successful product approvals and uptake in international markets. Their focus on expanding the pipeline and positive clinical trial results indicate a commitment to innovation and growth. However, challenges in obtaining reimbursement agreements in some markets may impact future revenue streams.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's optimistic outlook, successful product approvals, revenue growth, and focus on research and development indicate a favorable position. However, challenges in reimbursement agreements and the inherent risks of pharmaceutical development suggest a medium level of risk, which needs to be carefully managed to sustain growth and profitability.
