Step 1: The management discussion section is optimistic about the company's future, highlighting their profitability since inception, focus on developing new solutions, and emphasis on working closely with key vendors to introduce new technologies rapidly. A positive outlook is evident in statements such as: "In order to increase our sales and profits, we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and application-optimized server and storage solutions" and "Our management team is focused on guiding our company through the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19."

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures indicate both positive and negative trends. While net income increased for the three months ended December 31, 2020, net sales decreased by 4.7% during the same period. The gross margin increased, but the effective tax rate also increased significantly from 7.9% to 14.9%.

Step 3: The decrease in net sales, primarily attributed to lower sales volume and decreased number of units sold, raises concerns. Although there was an increase in gross margin, the rise in the effective tax rate could impact overall profitability negatively. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their operations, supply chain, and financials.

Step 4: Considering the optimistic sentiment of the management, the decrease in net sales, the increase in the effective tax rate, and the uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's medium risk of bankruptcy is assessed. While they have strategies in place to mitigate risks and have secured credit facilities, the decrease in sales volume and challenges in global operations present potential financial instability in the future.
