Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously pessimistic due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The discussion highlights various challenges faced by the company, such as disruptions in business operations, delays in product deliveries, and uncertainties regarding the full impact of the pandemic on financial performance. The need to allow customers to delay payments and the reduction in revenue from contracts with delayed payments indicate financial stress.

Step 2:
- Revenue Growth: The revenue increased due to investments by customers in new designs, but the increase is primarily driven by hardware, IP, and software offerings in China and the United States.
- Operating Expenses: Increased selling costs, marketing costs, and investments in research and development activities have impacted the operating expenses.
- Borrowings and Liquidity: The company borrowed $350.0 million under its revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity in response to global economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

Step 3: The increase in revenue, primarily from China and the U.S., is positive. However, the rise in operating expenses, the need to borrow for liquidity, and the impact of COVID-19 on delivery timings and revenue recognition point to financial strain. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's duration and severity further adds to the risks.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The cautious pessimism in the discussion, coupled with increased operating expenses, borrowings for liquidity, and uncertainties created by the pandemic affecting customer payments and product deliveries, suggest a precarious financial position. The company's reliance on borrowings and delays in revenue collection indicate potential cash flow challenges that could elevate the risk of bankruptcy in the near future.
