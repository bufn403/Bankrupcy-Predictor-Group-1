Step 1: The management's discussion in the filing reflects a cautious tone due to the uncertainties and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and highlights its strong brands and diverse product portfolio, there are concerns about ongoing and potential retail store closures, reduced consumer traffic, and supply chain disruptions. The company acknowledges challenges in attracting and retaining staff and increasing online competition.

Step 2: 
- Net Sales: The company experienced a decrease in net sales during the pandemic, especially in certain regions due to closures and limitations on retail stores. The revenue impact from reduced consumer activities and closures creates financial strain.
- Gross Margin: The gross margin improved due to higher full-priced selling and favorable exchange rates but may face pressure due to changes in consumer behavior and operating limitations.

Step 3: The company has faced challenges with retail store closures, reduced demand in brick-and-mortar stores, and increased online competition during the pandemic, impacting net sales. While the gross margin improved, the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, ongoing and potential retail store closures, and supply chain disruptions could continue to affect the company's financial performance.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The cautious tone in the management's discussion, coupled with challenges in retail operations, decreased consumer activities, and potential supply chain disruptions, pose medium-term risks to the company's financial stability. The adverse impact of the pandemic on net sales and operational challenges may increase the risk of financial distress in the future.
