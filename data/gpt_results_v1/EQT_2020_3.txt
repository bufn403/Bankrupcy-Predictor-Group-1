Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic. The discussion mentions a net loss for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. There are references to decreased operating revenues, increased interest expense, and decreased dividend and other income contributing to the negative financial results. This sentiment is exemplified by the statement: "The decrease was attributable primarily to decreased operating revenues, increased interest expense and decreased dividend and other income, partly offset by the gain on investment in Equitrans Midstream, increased income tax benefit, decreased transaction, proxy and reorganization expense, decreased depreciation and depletion expense and decreased selling, general and administrative expense."

Step 2: The relevant number mentioned is the net loss, which is highlighted as $600.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and $1,030.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The discussion also notes decreases in sales volumes, higher expenses, and losses on derivatives, further indicating financial challenges. For example, "Sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to a lower average realized price and lower sales volumes."

Step 3: The numbers and figures represent a failed quarter and year-to-date performance. The net losses, coupled with decreased sales volumes, lower average realized prices, and increased expenses, suggest a challenging financial situation. The mention of losses on derivatives not designated as hedges further adds to the financial woes. The statement, "Sales volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased 4% or... compared to the same period in 2019" demonstrates the decline in operational performance.

Step 4: Based on the pessimistic sentiment, poor financial numbers, and indications of ongoing challenges, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 and the oil price war, along with the company's significant losses and operational difficulties, contribute to this assessment. The final decision is supported by the overall negative tone of the management discussion and the unfavorable financial results outlined in the filing.
