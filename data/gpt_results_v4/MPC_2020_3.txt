Step 1: The management's discussion in the Form 10-Q filing presents significant challenges and uncertainties faced by the company, especially due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in economic disruptions globally, leading to reduced demand for refined petroleum products, impacting the company's financial performance negatively. There are references to strategic actions taken to address the impacts of the pandemic, including cost reductions, idling refineries, and workforce reductions.

Step 2: 
- Net income (loss) per diluted share data: The company reported a significant net loss in the third quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The loss in the Refining & Marketing segment, along with restructuring expenses and impairment charges, indicates financial distress.
- Inventory valuation: The company recorded an LCM inventory valuation reserve of $1.19 billion, reflecting a decline in market values. Future inventory valuation adjustments could further impact earnings negatively.

Step 3: The financial indicators point to a substantial decline in net income, with significant impairment charges and restructuring expenses during the period, indicating a failed quarter. The company's reliance on strategic actions to optimize assets and reduce costs reflects a challenging operational environment further exacerbated by the pandemic.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The extensive losses, impairment charges, and uncertainties surrounding the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest severe financial distress for the company. The inability to predict the ultimate economic impacts and the ongoing need for cost reductions and strategic actions highlight a high risk of bankruptcy in the near future.
