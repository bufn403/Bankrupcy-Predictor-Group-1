Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of optimism and caution. While the company discusses its strategic growth drivers and the successful execution of its business strategy, it also highlights the impact of COVID-19 on its operations. Therefore, the sentiment can be considered cautiously optimistic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The Working Capital to Total Assets ratio is 0.062, indicating a relatively low level of working capital in relation to the total assets. This could suggest a potential liquidity issue if the company faces financial challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio is 0.402, showing a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to total assets. This indicates a decent level of profitability and reinvestment capability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to Total Assets ratio is 0.107, representing the company's earnings generated in relation to its total assets. A higher value would indicate better profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio is 0.634, indicating that the company generates revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment analysis with the financial ratios, the company appears to have a moderate level of risk. Despite the optimistic growth strategies and revenue generation, the relatively low working capital to total assets ratio and the impact of COVID-19 on operations introduce a level of caution regarding the company's financial stability.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The cautious sentiment, along with the financial ratios indicating some liquidity concerns and the impact of external factors, suggest a level of risk that falls between low and high.
