Step 1: The management's discussion displays a cautious optimism about the company's operations. It mentions the impact of market fluctuations on revenues and the efforts to attract new clients and retain existing ones through various investment products and services. While they mention the challenge of passive investing trends, they emphasize the importance of active management over the long term.

Step 2:
- Assets under management increased by $90.4 billion in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by market appreciation and income.
- Investment advisory revenues increased from the U.S. mutual funds and other investment portfolios due to average assets under management growth.
- The company incurred significant expenses for developing new products and services and enhancing its capabilities, indicating high expenditure levels.
- Compensation and related costs increased in the third quarter of 2020 due to higher expenses for the supplemental savings plan, salaries, benefits, and employee costs.

Step 3: The company's assets under management increased significantly due to market appreciation, income, and client acquisitions. However, the high expenses for developing new products, compensation, and related costs could potentially strain the company's financial health despite revenue growth from the investment advisory services.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. Despite the growth in assets under management and investment advisory revenues, the high operating expenses, especially in compensation, raise concerns about the company's financial stability. The cautionary note about passive investing trends impacting new client inflows further compounds the risk, indicating potential challenges in revenue generation in the future. Overall, the high expenses relative to revenue growth suggest a precarious financial position, warranting a high-risk classification for bankruptcy.
