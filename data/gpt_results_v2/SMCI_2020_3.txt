Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion section appears to be cautiously optimistic. The company highlights its profitability since inception but also acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a mix of confidence and awareness of potential risks. One statement that influenced this decision is, "Our first priority is the safety of our workforce and we have implemented numerous health precautions and work practices to be in compliance with the law and to operate in a safe manner."

Step 2: The relevant numbers provided in the discussion show a decrease in net sales and an increase in gross margin. While net sales decreased by 4.7%, the gross margin increased from the previous year. This indicates cost management efforts and potential efficiency improvements within the company. One statement supporting this is, "Gross margin increased to 16.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 from 15.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2019."

Step 3: The company's discussion also mentions a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in the effective tax rate, which could indicate a strategic cost-cutting measure to maintain profitability. This suggests proactive measures taken by the company to manage its financial health. A statement supporting this is, "Operating expenses decreased by 10.7% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019."

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the sentiment, the decrease in net sales offset by an increase in gross margin, and the cost-cutting measures reflected in operational expenses, the company appears to be managing its financial situation reasonably well despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. While there are risks due to the ongoing uncertainties, the company's proactive approach and historical profitability suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy at the current moment.
