Medium Risk

Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the company's operations and financials. The company has taken proactive measures to protect employees and adjust its operations accordingly.

Step 2: The company has faced disruptions in its supply chain, higher costs related to transportation and labor, and decreased demand in certain end markets due to the pandemic. These factors have impacted the company's operational efficiency and financial performance.

Step 3: While the Consumer Solutions segment showed strong growth in certain areas like the pool business, there were declines in demand for water treatment products. The Industrial & Flow Technologies segment also experienced decreased sales volumes in various businesses. The company's overall financial performance is being affected by the pandemic-induced economic slowdown.

Based on the cautious sentiment, disruptions in the supply chain, increased costs, and decreased demand in certain segments, the company exhibits medium risk of bankruptcy as it navigates through the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.
