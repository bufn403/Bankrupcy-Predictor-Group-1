Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and slightly pessimistic due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial results. For example, "The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale... The impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. Its future effects are uncertain."

Step 2: The company has reported adverse impacts on financial results, such as a decrease in sales volume, credit card loan growth, and an increase in the estimate of credit losses.

The company's response to the economic environment reflects a level of risk that is not at a critical level but still needs attention.
