Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion seems cautious but optimistic about navigating through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They mention focusing on employee safety, maintaining financial strength, and ensuring the company emerges stronger from the crisis.

Step 2: The company reported an increase in sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2020, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. They mentioned a 4.7% increase in sales driven by the consumer segment, partially offset by a decline in the flavor solutions segment.

Step 3: The company's gross profit margins improved in the third quarter and nine months ended August 31, 2020, driven by favorable product mix and cost-saving measures. However, they also reported higher operating expenses due to factors like employee incentives and expenses related to implementing a global ERP platform.

Based on the cautious and adaptive approach taken by the company, coupled with the increase in sales and improved gross profit margins despite challenges, I classify the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to manage costs and adapt to changing consumer behaviors due to the pandemic provides some level of stability, but the ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19 could pose risks to future performance.
