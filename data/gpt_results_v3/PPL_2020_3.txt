Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of caution and proactive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential sale of the U.K. utility business. While the discussion mentions successful implementation of pandemic plans and mitigation steps, it also highlights the uncertainties and challenges ahead due to the outbreak's impact on the economy and markets.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) is negative (-0.0104), indicating potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) is relatively low (0.0691), suggesting lower earnings retention.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) is at 0.0405, indicating a moderate level of earnings generated in relation to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) is at 0.2118, showing a decent revenue generation efficiency.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment analysis with the financial ratios, we see a company facing challenges with negative working capital, lower retained earnings, and moderate EBIT to total assets ratio. While revenue generation efficiency is relatively good, the uncertainties surrounding the potential sale of the U.K. utility business and the ongoing COVID-19 impacts present risks to the company's financial stability.

Step 4: Based on the cautious sentiment in the management's discussion, coupled with the mix of financial ratios indicating liquidity issues and lower earnings retention, and the uncertainties mentioned, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial health appears to be under strain, requiring careful monitoring and proactive measures to navigate through the challenges ahead.
