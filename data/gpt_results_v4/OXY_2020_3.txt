Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion indicates a high level of caution and uncertainty about the future. The discussion is filled with forward-looking statements that highlight the risks and challenges the company is facing, especially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil demand and commodity prices. The statements warn investors about the uncertainties and potential negative outcomes that may occur, indicating a pessimistic outlook.

Step 2:
- Reduction in Capital Budget: Occidental significantly reduced its capital budget, which is a clear indication of financial strain and the need to cut costs drastically.
- Expenses Reduction and Dividend Cut: The company has made significant cuts to its operating and corporate costs and reduced its quarterly common stock dividend. These actions are typically undertaken in challenging financial situations to conserve cash.
- Asset Sales and Debt Issuance: Occidental resorted to selling assets and issuing senior unsecured notes to address near-term debt maturities and enhance liquidity. Asset sales for debt repayment indicate financial distress.
- Impairment Charges: Recognizing substantial impairment charges on oil and gas assets, coupled with losses on asset sales, signifies a weak financial position and declining asset values.

Step 3: The detailed description of the company's actions to increase liquidity, repay debt, and reduce costs, combined with the substantial impairment charges and losses, paint a concerning picture of the company's financial health. The dependency on oil prices and the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand and prices further exacerbate the risk of financial instability.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. Occidental Petroleum Corporation faces significant financial challenges, including substantial losses, impairment charges, debt maturities, and uncertainties in commodity prices. The cautious and pessimistic tone of the management's discussion, along with the drastic measures taken to address liquidity issues, indicate a high risk of potential bankruptcy in the near future.
