Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is both cautious and optimistic. While they acknowledge the impact of COVID-19 on their operations, they also highlight their efforts to resume operations gradually and their collaborations with health authorities to implement safety protocols. The management discusses financial challenges but also emphasizes actions taken to preserve cash and secure financing, indicating a proactive approach to the situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The negative value of -0.1265 indicates that the company may have more liabilities than assets in the short term, which could pose a risk to its financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a low value of 0.0038, the company has a small proportion of retained earnings compared to its total assets, which may suggest limited financial cushioning.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The value of 0.0408 shows the company's ability to generate earnings relative to its total assets, but it is not exceptionally high.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The value of 0.4396 indicates that the company generates a moderate amount of revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: Considering the financial ratios alongside the management's discussion, the company appears to be actively managing its financial situation amidst the challenges brought by the pandemic. While they have implemented cost-saving measures and secured additional financing, the negative working capital and low retained earnings suggest a need for careful financial management.

Step 4: The company exhibits a medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite proactive measures and a gradual return to operations, the financial ratios indicate some vulnerabilities in terms of short-term liquidity and retained earnings. Continued monitoring of financial health and prudent financial management will be crucial for mitigating the risks highlighted by the ratios.
