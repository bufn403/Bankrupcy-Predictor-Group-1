Step 1: The management's discussion reflects the challenges faced by Wabtec due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company is navigating the uncertainties related to the pandemic and its impact on various aspects of the business, such as sales channels, supply chain, and workforce, the overall tone appears realistic about the adverse effects faced by the company. The management expresses concerns about the pandemic's continued impact on sales, cash flow, and operational efficiency.

Step 2: 
- Net Sales: The company experienced a decrease in net sales due to lower freight rail volumes, reduced passenger traffic, and COVID-19 related production delays.
- Cost of Sales: Despite the decrease in net sales, the cost of sales remained relatively high, impacting the cost of sales as a percentage of sales.
- Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses decreased, primarily due to cost-saving measures put in place in response to the pandemic, but restructuring and transaction costs were incurred and impacted the SG&A expenses.
- Interest Expense: The net interest expense decreased, attributable to lower variable interest rates and decreased debt balances.

Step 3: The company faced challenges during the third quarter of the year, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in net sales, increased cost of sales as a percentage of sales, and restructuring costs indicate a period of financial strain. Despite some cost-saving measures and reduced interest expenses, the overall impact of the pandemic on Wabtec's operations and financial results has been significant.

Step 4: 
Considering the challenges faced by Wabtec due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the medium risk of bankruptcy is assigned. The company's decreased net sales, high cost of sales as a percentage of sales, restructuring costs, and uncertainties related to the pandemic's impact on operational efficiency suggest a level of financial vulnerability. While cost-saving measures and reduced interest expenses provide some resilience, the overall financial strain portrayed in the management's discussion warrants a medium risk classification.
