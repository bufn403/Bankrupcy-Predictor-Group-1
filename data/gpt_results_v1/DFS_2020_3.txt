Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic. The company expresses concerns about the ongoing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, stating, "The pandemic has adversely impacted our financial results" and "the economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19 will likely continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."

Step 2: The company provides specific figures and numbers indicating a decline in financial performance, such as "pretax income of $917 million and $272 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to pretax income of $943 million and $2.8 billion for the same periods in 2019." This demonstrates a significant decrease in profitability.

Step 3: The company mentions, "Outbreaks of COVID-19 have resulted in state and local governments implementing measures to contain the virus, impacting consumer and business spending habits." They also highlight an increase in credit losses due to the pandemic and anticipate further credit losses. These factors suggest a failed quarter with conditions likely to worsen.

Based on the pessimistic sentiment, the decline in financial figures, and the anticipation of ongoing financial impact from the pandemic, the company is at a high risk of bankruptcy.
