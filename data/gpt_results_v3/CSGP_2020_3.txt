Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While they have taken measures to adapt to the situation, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its effects on business operations are acknowledged. This cautious tone indicates a level of concern about the future outlook.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The working capital to total assets ratio is 0.5628, which indicates that the company has a moderate ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio is 0.2471, suggesting that the company has retained a substantial portion of its earnings relative to its total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to total assets ratio is 0.0316, indicating that the company's earnings before interest and taxes in relation to its total assets are relatively low.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The total revenue to total assets ratio is 0.2752, showing that the company generates a moderate amount of revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the cautious sentiment expressed in the management's discussion with the financial ratios, we can see that while the company has a moderate ability to cover short-term obligations and has retained earnings, its profitability in relation to total assets is relatively low. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evident in the discussion, with mentions of decreased sales volume, potential asset impairment charges, and increases in customer cancellations.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, mixed financial ratios, and the challenges posed by the pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance, the overall assessment leans towards a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company seems to be navigating through difficult circumstances, but the uncertainties highlighted in the discussion indicate potential challenges ahead.
