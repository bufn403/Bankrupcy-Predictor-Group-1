Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is optimistic. The company highlights positive aspects of its performance such as global retail sales growth, successful product launches, and store expansion despite challenges like the impact of COVID-19 on international markets. One quote supporting the optimistic sentiment is, "Our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand."

Step 2: The company experienced increases in global retail sales, U.S. and international same store sales growth, and opened new stores. It also mentions that net income increased, driven by higher income from operations. One relevant quote is, "Total revenues increased $146.9 million, or 17.9%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $292.4 million, or 11.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020."

Step 3: Despite challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company managed to adapt, with most U.S. stores remaining open, and disruptions in international markets lessening. The company's ability to meet debt service requirements, invest in the business, and generate positive operating cash flows indicates a relatively successful quarter. A quote supporting this is, "During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year."

Step 4: Considering the optimistic sentiment, positive financial results, successful adaptation during the pandemic, and the company's ability to generate positive operating cash flows, the company appears to have a low risk of bankruptcy in the near future. The strong financial performance and strategic business decisions indicate a stable operational and financial position.
