Step 1: The management's discussion is realistic and acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 on their business. They have implemented various measures to adapt to the changes brought by the pandemic, showing a level-headed approach without extreme optimism or pessimism.

Step 2: The company's financials show mixed results. While there was an increase in property rental revenues due to store acquisitions, there was also a decrease related to lower rental rates and other fee income at stabilized stores, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tenant reinsurance revenues increased, but there were higher expenses noted across different categories.

Step 3: The company mentioned improvements in occupancy rates, achieved rates, accounts receivable, and collections as restrictions began to lessen. However, they also highlighted reduced revenue from existing customers leading to higher bad debt, lower rental rates, and reduced late fee collections due to the pandemic, impacting overall financial performance.

Step 4: Taking the sentiment, financial figures, and outlook into account, the company shows a medium risk of bankruptcy. While they have adapted to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and are showing signs of recovery, the impact on their financials and uncertainties regarding future developments indicate a level of risk that falls between low and high. The company's ability to manage its cash flows, occupancy levels, and respond to market conditions will be crucial in determining their future financial stability.
