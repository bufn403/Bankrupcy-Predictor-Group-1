Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of caution and optimism. While the impacts of COVID-19 are acknowledged, there is also a focus on digital transformation and continued investment in services. 

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.2229567188214477 - This ratio indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital in relation to its total assets. 
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.5249781307779479 - This ratio shows that a significant portion of total assets is tied up in retained earnings, which can be a positive sign of stability. 
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.2137840712539016 - This ratio suggests that the company's EBIT is relatively low compared to its total assets, which could indicate operational challenges.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment from the management's discussion and the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 on advertising revenues, but is also adapting through increased spending by advertisers and investment in digital transformation. The financial ratios show a mixed picture with some indicators of stability (e.g., retained earnings) and others pointing to potential operational difficulties (e.g., low EBIT).

Step 4: In conclusion, the company's medium risk of bankruptcy is determined by the cautious yet optimistic tone of the management discussion, the varying financial ratios suggesting a mix of stability and challenges, and the overall outlook of adapting to the changing business landscape.
