Step 1: The management's discussion indicates significant challenges arising from both the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the broader economic conditions. The company highlighted broad risks including the current pandemic, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating currencies, and potential impact from tariffs and trade policies. The management emphasizes the adverse effect of these factors on the company's operations and financial results.

Step 2:
- Sales Decline: The company recorded a decrease in sales across different segments, reflecting lower demand from customers and various industries impacted by the pandemic. For example, "Sales of $220.7 million decreased $20.1 million, or 8%, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019."
- Reduced Gross Margins: The gross margin decreased due to lower volume, business mix, and restructuring expenses, indicating challenges with cost management and operational efficiency.
- Operating Income Decline: Operating income and operating margin decreased, primarily attributed to lower volume, higher restructuring expenses, and adverse business mix, despite some offset from restructuring savings.

Step 3: The company experienced notable declines in sales, operating income, and gross margins during the reporting period. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including lower customer demand and disruptions across various industries, have significantly affected the company's financial performance. Despite taking cost-saving measures and implementing safety protocols, the company faced challenges in maintaining profitability due to the prevailing economic conditions.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The substantial decrease in sales, coupled with declining profitability indicators like reduced gross margin and operating income, suggest significant financial distress for the company. The management's acknowledgment of ongoing challenges and the uncertain duration of the pandemic reinforce the high risk of bankruptcy for the company in the near term.
