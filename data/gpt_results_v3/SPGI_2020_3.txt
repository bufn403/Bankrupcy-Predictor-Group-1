Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall tone of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They mention monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on their business but also discuss strategic priorities and driving excellence through core business offerings.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0162, indicating negative working capital, which can be a sign of financial instability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.3091, showing a moderate level of retained earnings relative to total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0661, indicating a moderate level of earnings relative to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.2063, showing a moderate level of revenue generated relative to total assets.

Step 3: The combination of negative working capital (X1) and moderate financial ratios (X2, X3, X5) suggests a mixed financial health outlook. The text mentions revenue growth at all segments contributing to increased operating profit, but also includes various charges such as severance charges and impairment charges, which could impact profitability.

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the management's discussion, moderately positive financial ratios, and the challenges mentioned in the text, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positive aspects such as revenue growth, there are also factors like negative working capital and various charges affecting profitability that warrant caution.
