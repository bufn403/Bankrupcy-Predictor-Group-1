The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading “Forward-Looking Information” and “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).The following discussion includes organic net sales growth (decline) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure.
TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.
●Our net sales increased 3.8% and 2.2% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2022 due to sales growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, partially offset by declines in the Communications Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 7.6% and 7.7% during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2022.●Our net sales by segment were as follows:●Transportation Solutions—Our net sales increased 7.3% and 6.0% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, due primarily to sales increases in the automotive end market.●Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 11.5% and 6.2% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, as a result of sales increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine, the energy, and the medical end markets, partially offset by declines in the industrial equipment end market.●Communications Solutions—Our net sales decreased 22.2% and 18.2% in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, due to sales declines in the data and devices and the appliances end markets.●Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,215 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023.
Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted by supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures as well as the military
Table of Contentsconflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.We have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to partially mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through price increases or productivity. We have implemented select price increases for certain products. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”We are monitoring the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, escalating tensions in surrounding countries, and associated sanctions. We sold our business operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine have been reduced. Neither Russia nor Ukraine represents a material portion of our business, and the military conflict did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the first six months of fiscal 2023. The extent to which the conflict may impact our business in future periods will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict, its impact on regional and global economic conditions, and supply chain disruptions. We will continue to actively monitor the conflict and assess the related sanctions and other effects and may take further actions if necessary.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact, most recently and significantly in China, and has resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns. While the pandemic has impacted certain aspects of our business, the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the resurgence of the spread of the virus and variant strains of the virus as well as the success of public health advancements. While certain of our operations in China were impacted in the first six months of fiscal 2023 and were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in fiscal 2023. However, it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. We will continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate.OutlookIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect our net sales to be approximately $4.0 billion as compared to $4.1 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease reflects sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment, partially offset by growth in the Transportation Solutions segment. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.56 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.AcquisitionDuring the first six months of fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $108 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.DivestituresDuring the first six months of fiscal 2023, we sold two businesses for net cash proceeds of $51 million. In connection with the divestitures, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges and a net pre-tax gain on sales, which totaled to a net charge of $2 million. The businesses sold were both reported in our Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, during the first six months of fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $60 million in connection with a held for sale business in the Transportation Solutions segment. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.22
The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment:
The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment:
Net sales increased $153 million, or 3.8%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 7.6%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.9% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $166 million.In the first six months of fiscal 2023, net sales increased $176 million, or 2.2%, as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 7.7%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 5.6% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $295 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023.See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”Net Sales by Geographic Region.  Our business operates in three geographic regions—Asia–Pacific, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period.Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first six months of fiscal 2023.
The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region(1):
(1)Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region:
The following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information:
Gross margin decreased $53 million and $96 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2022 due primarily to inflationary pressure on material and operating costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing actions.We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been impacted by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures, and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials; however, we have
been able to initiate pricing actions which have partially offset these impacts. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, silver, and palladium:
We expect to purchase approximately 185 million pounds of copper, 120,000 troy ounces of gold, 2.5 million troy ounces of silver, and 8,000 troy ounces of palladium in fiscal 2023.
The following table presents operating expense information:
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $19 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due primarily to the impact of cost inflation, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $48 million as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022 due primarily to a gain on the sale of real estate in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and the impact of cost inflation, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.  We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.During fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring program associated with cost structure improvements across all segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of $166 million during the first six months of fiscal 2023. Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2023 actions commenced during the first six months of fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $125 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2025. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2023, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $250 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $225 million.During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $60 million in connection with a held for sale business in the Transportation Solutions segment.See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Income Taxes.  See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of income taxes.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and participating countries continue to work towards the enactment of a 15% global minimum tax. South Korea and Japan are the first countries to enact the global minimum tax. European Union members must adopt the global minimum tax by the end of calendar 2023 and many other jurisdictions have also committed to implementing the global minimum tax. The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which will affect us beginning in fiscal 2025. Although global enactment has begun, the OECD and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. We are currently monitoring these developments and evaluating the potential impact on our results of operations, cash taxes, and worldwide corporate effective tax rate.
Effective for fiscal 2023, we realigned certain product lines from the Industrial Solutions segment to the Communications Solutions segment. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment
reporting structure. See Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.

Excluding the items below, operating income decreased due primarily to lower volume.
Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs.
In the first six months of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities increased $270 million to $1,215 million from $945 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from the impact of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by lower pre-tax income. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $223 million and $177 million, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $372 million and $351 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect fiscal 2023 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we received net cash proceeds of $51 million related to the sale of two businesses. We received net cash proceeds of $16 million related to the sale of two businesses during the first six months of fiscal 2022. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.During the first six months of fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $108 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $127 million, net of cash acquired, during the first six
Table of Contentsmonths of fiscal 2022. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing Activities and CapitalizationTotal debt at March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022 was $4,202 million and $4,206 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due in February 2026. The notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, €550 million of 1.10% senior notes due in March 2023.As of March 31, 2023, TEGSA had $285 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.5%. TEGSA had $370 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.45% at September 30, 2022.TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of $1.5 billion. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 31, 2023 or September 30, 2022.The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $355 million and $326 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.In March 2023, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.36 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.59 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.We repurchased approximately four million of our common shares for $432 million and approximately five million of our common shares for $752 million under the share repurchase program during the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. At March 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.​33
As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries. The following tables present summarized financial information, excluding investments in and equity in earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, for TE Connectivity Ltd. and TEGSA on a combined basis.
(1)Includes $2,546 million and $2,601 million as of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, of intercompany loans receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries.  (2)Includes $5,166 million and $12,582 million as of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, of intercompany loans payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries.
In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2023 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.At March 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $171 million, excluding those related to our former Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business which are discussed below.During fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately $58 million as of March 31, 2023 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.
Table of ContentsCommitments and ContingenciesLegal ProceedingsIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Trade Compliance MattersWe have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension plans are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. There were no significant changes to this information during the first six months of fiscal 2023.Non-GAAP Financial MeasureOrganic Net Sales Growth (Decline)We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in 35
“Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP.Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
