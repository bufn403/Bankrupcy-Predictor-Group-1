Step 1: The management's discussions contain a blend of historical facts and forward-looking statements. While acknowledging uncertainties like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market risks, the tone is generally forward-looking and optimistic about the future prospects of the company.

Step 2: 
- Net sales increased by 9.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by acquisitions and core organic growth.
- Gross margin percentage decreased from 27.2% to 25.8% for the same period due to commodity price inflation.
- Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 3.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, but as a percentage of sales, decreased from 21.4% to 20.3%.

Step 3: Despite challenges like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity price inflation affecting the gross margin, the company has shown resilience in its financial performance. There's a focus on growth through acquisitions and core organic growth, supported by the increase in net sales. The management's efforts to control expenses and optimize the balance sheet by executing debt transactions also indicate proactive financial management.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to adapt to market conditions, overall growth in net sales, and control over expenses, suggest a stable financial position. Despite challenges posed by factors like commodity price fluctuations and the pandemic, the management's strategic focus on growth and financial optimization supports a low risk of bankruptcy.
