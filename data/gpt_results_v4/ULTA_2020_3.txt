Step 1: The management's discussion includes forward-looking statements acknowledging uncertainties and risks associated with various factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, economic conditions, consumer behavior changes, and market dynamics. They express caution in predicting future performance due to these uncertainties.

Step 2: 
- Net Sales: The company experienced a significant decrease in net sales, primarily driven by the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decline in comparable sales. This indicates a challenging period for the company in terms of revenue generation.
- Gross Profit: Gross profit decreased significantly, and gross profit margin also decreased due to lower sales, channel mix shifts, and higher costs related to the pandemic. This suggests financial strain and challenges in maintaining profitability.
- Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Costs: The company incurred substantial costs related to impairment and restructuring, indicating financial difficulties that may impact its overall financial health.
- Operating Expenses: While selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased, they remained a significant portion of net sales, leading to a higher percentage compared to the previous year. This can indicate ongoing operational challenges.

Step 3: The significant decrease in net sales and gross profit, along with substantial impairment and restructuring costs, paint a picture of financial strain for the company during the discussed period. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the company's operations and financial performance, leading to challenges in revenue generation and maintaining profitability. The uncertainties surrounding the future due to the pandemic and related economic conditions add further risk.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The combination of reduced net sales, decreased profitability, impairment costs, and ongoing uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic indicate a moderate level of risk for the company. The financial strain and challenges faced by the company suggest a medium risk of potential bankruptcy in the near future.
