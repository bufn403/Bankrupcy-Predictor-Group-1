Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious and acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. The discussion highlights the adverse effects of the pandemic, temporary store closures, reduced customer demand, and increased costs related to COVID-19 measures. While the company took various measures to manage expenses and enhance financial flexibility, there is uncertainty about the duration and severity of the pandemic's impact.

Step 2: 
- Sales: The company experienced a significant decline in sales due to the store closures and reduced customer demand caused by the pandemic. Sales decreased for both the three-month and nine-month periods, negatively impacting the financial performance.
- Cost of Goods Sold: The cost of goods sold increased due to lower sales, higher markdowns to clear aged inventory, and increased expenses related to COVID-19 measures.
- Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenses increased substantially for both the three-month and nine-month periods, primarily due to COVID-related expenses, long-term debt refinancing costs, and additional safety protocols, impacting the company's financial position.
- Interest Expense: The interest expense increased significantly, primarily due to higher interest on long-term debt, lower interest income, and higher short-term debt interest costs.
- Net Earnings (Loss): The company reported a net loss for the nine-month period, compared to net earnings in the prior year, mainly due to the adverse effects of the pandemic on sales, increased expenses, and higher interest costs.

Step 3: The financial results of the company indicate significant challenges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company had to take various cost-saving measures, raise additional capital through debt offerings, and suspend stock repurchase programs and dividends to enhance liquidity. While the company managed to improve its liquidity position, the ongoing uncertainty and potential for further disruptions suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial performance has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a net loss, increased expenses, and substantial challenges in sales and liquidity. Despite taking necessary measures to manage costs and enhance financial flexibility, the continued uncertainties, potential future store closures, and consumer behavior changes pose a significant risk to the company's financial health.
