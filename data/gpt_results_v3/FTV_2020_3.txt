Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious due to factors like the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations. While there is mention of positive momentum in certain businesses, uncertainties remain regarding the global economic conditions and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.111 indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital relative to its total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.443 shows that a significant portion of the company's assets are tied up in retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.065 suggests that the company's earnings before interest and taxes may be relatively low compared to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.359 indicates that the company generates a moderate level of revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: The text highlights both positive and challenging aspects of the company's performance. While there is mention of sequential improvement in demand and positive momentum in certain businesses, the overall impact of COVID-19 on global economic conditions and the company's operations presents ongoing challenges. The financial ratios show a mixed picture with moderate working capital, significant retained earnings, and relatively low earnings before interest and taxes.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment in the management's discussion, the moderate financial ratios, and the overall uncertainty caused by the pandemic, I would classify the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The combination of cautious outlook, mixed financial ratios, and ongoing challenges suggests a level of risk that falls between low and high.
