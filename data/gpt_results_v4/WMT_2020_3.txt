Step 1: The management's discussion presents the financial results for Walmart Inc., focusing on periods ending in January 2021 and comparing those results with the prior fiscal year. The discussions highlight strategic actions taken and financial metrics used to assess the company's performance. Some of the significant points discussed include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales growth, initiatives to support associates, and adjustments in business strategies to maintain competitiveness during uncertain times.

Step 2:

- Net Sales Growth: The discussion mentions that overall net sales growth was strong, driven by positive comparable sales in the U.S. and international markets, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards food, consumables, and eCommerce due to the pandemic.
- Impact of Currency Exchange Rates: Fluctuations in exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales growth, indicating potential challenges from global economic conditions.
- Divestitures and Loss Recognition: The company recognized non-cash losses related to divestitures of certain entities like Asda, Walmart Argentina, and Seiyu, indicating potential financial strain from these transactions.

Step 3: The financial results of Walmart Inc. show a mixed performance, with strong net sales growth driven by changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic. However, challenges related to currency exchange rates and significant losses from divestitures suggest financial pressures. Despite cost management efforts and operational improvements, the company's decisions to recognize substantial losses may impact its financial health negatively in the future.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The combination of challenges from currency exchange rates, significant non-cash losses from divestitures, and uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic indicate a high risk of bankruptcy for Walmart Inc. The positive aspects of net sales growth are overshadowed by these financial strains and the potential long-term impacts on the company's financial stability.
