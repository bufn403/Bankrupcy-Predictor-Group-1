Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While there are mentions of challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an emphasis on the company's resilience, sustainability strategy, and strong financial position. The text states, "Despite these challenges, all production facilities remain open and we continue to sell, install and service our products." This indicates a level of confidence in navigating through the current economic conditions.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The working capital to total assets ratio is 0.0421, indicating that the company has a limited ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio is 0.4710, suggesting that a significant portion of the company's total assets is financed by its retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to total assets ratio is 0.1445, showing that the company is generating a moderate level of earnings compared to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The total revenue to total assets ratio is 0.9116, indicating that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently to generate revenue.

Step 3: The financial ratios show a mixed picture. While the company is efficiently generating revenue from its assets and has moderate earnings, the low working capital to total assets ratio suggests a potential strain in covering short-term obligations. The reliance on retained earnings for financing may indicate stability but also limits flexibility in the face of unforeseen challenges. Overall, the financial health appears to be stable but not without vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Combining the sentiment of the management's discussion, the financial ratios, and the overall assessment of financial health, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite showing resilience and a strong financial position, the limited working capital and potential challenges highlighted in the text indicate a level of risk that cannot be ignored. The company should continue to monitor its liquidity and adapt to changing economic conditions to mitigate any potential bankruptcy risks.
