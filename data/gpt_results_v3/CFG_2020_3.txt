Final Decision: Medium
    
Step 1: The overall sentiment of the Management Discussion Text does not explicitly indicate optimism or pessimism. It provides a detailed analysis of the company's financial performance, discussing both positive and challenging aspects. Without clear indications of optimism or pessimism in the text, we need to rely more heavily on the financial ratios to assess the bankruptcy risk.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): X1 ratio of 0.0 indicates that the company's working capital is insufficient to cover its total assets, which can be a concerning sign.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): X2 ratio of 0.0442 shows that the company's retained earnings are relatively low compared to its total assets, which may pose a risk in case of financial difficulties.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): X3 ratio of 0.0 suggests that the company's earnings before interest and taxes are not generating sufficient returns in relation to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): X5 ratio of 0.0370 indicates that the company's total revenue generated from its total assets is relatively low.

Step 3: The financial ratios paint a picture of financial instability with low working capital, relatively low retained earnings, low EBIT to total assets ratio, and low total revenue to total assets ratio. The challenges highlighted in the text, such as a decrease in net income compared to the previous year, further contribute to the concerns regarding the company's financial health. The impact of COVID-19 on the business operations and financial performance adds another layer of uncertainty.

Step 4: Considering the financial ratios indicating potential financial strain and the mixed tone of the management discussion text regarding the challenging environment, it is reasonable to classify the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The lack of positive indicators in the financial ratios and uncertainties highlighted in the text point towards a potentially risky financial position. The company needs to address the issues highlighted to mitigate the risk of bankruptcy in the future.
