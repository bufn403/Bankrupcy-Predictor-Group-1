Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. There is acknowledgment of challenges such as the impact of COVID-19 on interest income and credit losses, but also mention of new partnerships and program launches.
Quote: "Net earnings decreased 70.4% to $313 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased 78.5% to $647 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020"

Step 2: Relevant numbers indicate a decrease in net earnings, interest income, and average loan receivables due to COVID-19 and the sale of portfolios. There is also mention of increases in provision for credit losses.
Quote: "Loan receivables decreased 5.6% to $78.5 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to September 30, 2019"

Step 3: The conditions have worsened with decreases in interest income, net earnings, and sales volume, primarily driven by COVID-19 impact, and there are anticipated increases in delinquencies and charge-offs.
Quote: "Interest and fees on loans decreased 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period"

Step 4: Given the mixed sentiment, significant decreases in key financial metrics, and anticipated negative impacts on delinquencies and charge-offs, the company is categorized as having a medium risk of bankruptcy.
Quote: "To the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further, we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to COVID-19."
