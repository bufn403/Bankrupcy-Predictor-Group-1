We provide manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Our customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in electronic products. Each of our segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic, political and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.We operate in three reportable segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect our operations is set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the United States, Europe, Israel, and Asia. Our broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.Our results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next-generation process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end-market demand. In light of these conditions, our results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.The following table presents certain significant measurements for the periods indicated:
Fiscal 2023 and 2022 each contain 52 weeks and the first three months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 each contained 13 weeks. Semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions and new capacity during the three months ended January 29, 2023. Foundry and logic spending increased in the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year driven primarily by customer investment in mature nodes. Memory customers’ spending in the three months ended January 29, 2023 was lower as compared to the same period in the prior year due to certain customers deferring capacity additions as a result of weak demand in consumer electronics, including personal computers and smartphones.Our Applied Global Services net sales in the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in legacy systems sales, partially offset by a decrease in long-term service agreements and spares due to additional export regulations issued by the United States government in 2022. Our Display and Adjacent Markets net sales decreased in the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower customer investments in display manufacturing equipment as a result of weakness in the consumer electronics market, including personal computers and smartphones.We experienced supply chain and logistics constraints in fiscal 2022, and although there have been improvements in supply chain performance, we expect some shortages to persist through the remainder of fiscal 2023, and managing these supply chain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority. In addition, one of our major suppliers recently experienced a cybersecurity incident that is expected to impact our second quarter shipments.In 2022, the United States government announced additional export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China. These export regulations resulted in lower net sales in China for our Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. For a description of risks associated with global trade, see the risk factor entitled “Business and Industry Risks - Global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors” in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Net sales for the periods indicated were as follows:
For the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year, net sales increased primarily due to continued customer investment in semiconductor equipment and improvements in our supply chain performance enabling us to better fulfill demand in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net sales was partially offset by the reduction in customer investment in display manufacturing equipment. The Semiconductor Systems segment continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales.Net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers’ facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
The increase in net sales in Taiwan for the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflected increased investment by customers in semiconductor equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in China for the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflected decreased investment in semiconductor equipment and long-term service agreements due to the impact of additional export regulations issued by the United States government in 2022 and decreased investment in display manufacturing equipment due to weak consumer demand for TVs and mobile products. The changes in net sales in all other regions in the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflected changes in semiconductor manufacturing equipment spending.  Gross margins for the periods indicated were as follows:  Three Months Ended January 29,2023January 30,2022Change Gross margin46.7 %47.2 %(0.5) pointsGross margin in the three months ended January 29, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher material costs, freight and logistics costs, inventory charges, unfavorable changes in product mix and the impact of export regulations, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices. Gross margin during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 included $54 million and $42 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.
Research, Development and Engineering (RD&E) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended January 29,2023January 30,2022Change (In millions)Research, development and engineering$771 $654 $117 Our future operating results depend to a considerable extent on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products we provide. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of our existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, we acquire technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement our existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. We believe that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of our customers’ most advanced designs. We have maintained and intend to continue our commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.The increases in RD&E expenses during the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year were primarily due to additional headcount, higher variable and share-based compensation and higher consumable and equipment costs associated with ongoing product development. These increases reflect our ongoing investments in product development initiatives, consistent with our growth strategy. We continued to prioritize existing RD&E investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. RD&E expenses during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 included $54 million and $43 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.
Marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:  Three Months Ended January 29,2023January 30,2022Change (In millions)Marketing and selling$197 $167 $30 Marketing and selling expenses for the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in prior year primarily due to additional headcount, higher variable compensation and share-based compensation. Marketing and selling expenses during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 included $17 million and $14 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:  Three Months Ended January 29,2023January 30,2022Change (In millions)General and administrative$207 $166 $41 G&A expenses in the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to additional headcount, higher variable and share-based compensation and higher professional fees. G&A expenses during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 included $23 million and $19 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.
Interest expense and interest and other income (loss), net for the periods indicated were as follows:
Interest expense incurred was primarily associated with issued senior unsecured notes. Interest expense in the three months ended January 29, 2023 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year.Interest and other income, net in the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest income and higher net gain from equity investments, compared to the same period in the prior year.
Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows:
Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that vary from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings.Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 12.4 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was higher than the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions and larger excess tax benefits from share-based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Beginning in our fiscal 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for activities performed in the U.S. or fifteen years for activities performed outside of the U.S.. This capitalization requirement is expected to increase our effective tax rates, deferred tax assets and cash tax liabilities beginning in fiscal 2023.
We report financial results in three segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. The Corporate and Other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to our reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. These operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and RD&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, we do not allocate to our reportable segments restructuring, severance and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.
The Semiconductor Systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. Semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. Development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance.Certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows:
Net sales for Semiconductor Systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows:
Net sales for the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year. Semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions and new capacity during the first three months of fiscal 2023. Foundry and logic spending increased in the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by customer investment in mature nodes. Spending by memory customers decreased in the three months ended January 29, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year due to certain customers deferring capacity additions as a result of weak demand in consumer electronics including, personal computer and smartphones.Operating margin for the three months ended January 29, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by higher material costs, freight and logistics costs, inventory charges and unfavorable changes in product mix, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices. In the three months ended January 29, 2023, two customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales, and together they accounted for approximately 49 percent of this segment’s total net sales, with one customer accounting for approximately 32 percent of net sales.
The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products.Demand for Applied Global Services’ solutions are driven by our large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Industry conditions that affect Applied Global Services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and higher utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and our ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.Certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows:
Net sales for the three months ended January 29, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending on legacy systems, offset by lower customer spending on comprehensive service agreements and spares due to additional export regulations issued by the United States government in 2022. Operating margin for the three months ended January 29, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the export regulations and higher inventory charges, partially offset by favorable changes in product mix and an increase in average selling prices. In the three months ended January 29, 2023, two customers accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales.
The Display and Adjacent Markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and OLED displays, and other display technologies for TVs, monitors, laptops, personal computers, electronic tablets, smart phones, other consumer-oriented devices, equipment upgrades and solar energy cells. The segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale LCD TVs, OLEDs, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields. Display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next-generation mobile devices. Uneven spending patterns by customers in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over-year.Certain significant measures for the periods presented were as follows:
Net sales for the three months ended January 29, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower customer investments in display manufacturing equipment as a result of weakness in the consumer electronics market, including personal computers and smartphones. Operating margin for the three months ended January 29, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower net sales, partially offset by a reduction in headcount related costs as headcount moved to open positions within Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services segments. In the three months ended January 29, 2023, five customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment’s net sales, and together they accounted for approximately 83 percent of this segment’s total net sales.
Our cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
A summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
Cash from operating activities for the three months ended January 29, 2023 was $2.3 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. Significant non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in the first three months of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower year over year change in deferred revenue and lower income tax refunds, partially offset by lower inventory payments. We have agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. We sell our accounts receivable generally without recourse. From time to time, we also discount letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. We sold $279 million and $205 million of account receivables during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. We did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively.Our working capital was $9.5 billion as of January 29, 2023 and $8.5 billion as of October 30, 2022.Days sales outstanding for the three months ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 were 73 days and 64 days, respectively. Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. The increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance as a result of timing of customer payments and unfavorable revenue linearity compared to the same period in the prior year.
We used $299 million of cash in investing activities during the three months ended January 29, 2023. Capital expenditures totaled $287 million, net cash paid for acquisitions was $20 million, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments were $8 million, during the three months ended January 29, 2023.Our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. We regularly monitor the credit risk in our investment portfolio and take appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with our investment policies.
We used $418 million of cash in financing activities during the three months ended January 29, 2023, consisting primarily of cash used for repurchases of common stock of $250 million, dividends to stockholders of $220 million, tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $136 million, partially offset by net proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes of $198 million.In December 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payable in March 2023, in the amount of $0.26 per share. We currently anticipate that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.In March 2022, our Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing $6.0 billion in repurchases. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $4.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program.We have credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of banks. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a provision under which we may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. Subsequent to the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to extend the termination date of the Revolving Credit Agreement from February 2025 to February 2026. The termination date may be further extended as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by us, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to our public debt credit ratings. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial and other covenants with which we were in compliance as of January 29, 2023.Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $62 million are with Japanese banks. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both January 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022. We have a short-term commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of $1.5 billion. As of January 29, 2023, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million and may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future. The proceeds from the issuances of the commercial paper program are used for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper program is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes we can issue. We had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of January 29, 2023. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional discussion of existing debt. We may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on our capital requirements and the availability of financing.In the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either us or our subsidiaries. As of January 29, 2023, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $614 million. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.We also have agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of January 29, 2023, we have provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $300 million to cover these arrangements.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years, with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018. As of January 29, 2023, we had $694 million of total payments remaining, payable in installments in the next four years.Beginning in fiscal 2023, the Tax Act eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for activities performed in the U.S. or fifteen years for activities performed outside of the U.S.. This capitalization requirement is expected to increase our effective tax rates, deferred tax assets and cash tax liabilities beginning in fiscal 2023.On August 9, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (“CHIPS Act”). The CHIPS Act creates a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The credit is provided for qualifying property, which is placed in service after December 31, 2022, and is treated as a government grant. We do not expect the credit to have a significant impact on our financial statements.On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax, based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. Applicable corporations would be allowed to claim a credit for the minimum tax paid against regular tax in future years. The minimum tax may impact our financial results starting in fiscal 2024. We will evaluate the effect of the corporate minimum tax as more guidance becomes available. The Inflation Reduction Act also includes an excise tax that imposes a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases. This excise tax was effective January 1, 2023. The excise tax is included in our direct cost of stock repurchases and is recorded in equity. We do not expect the excise tax to have a significant impact on our financial results.Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, our management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding our operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows in this report.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and as updated as applicable in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this report describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended October 30, 2022.
