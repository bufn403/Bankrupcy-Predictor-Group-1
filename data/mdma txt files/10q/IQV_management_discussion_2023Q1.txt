Total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services. We do not have any material product revenues.
Our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our cost of revenues including reimbursed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of revenues includes compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production, trial monitoring, data management and delivery, and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings; costs of staff directly involved with delivering technology-related services offerings and engagements, related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements; and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees, laboratory supplies, professional services and travel expenses. Reimbursed expenses, which are included in cost of revenues, are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales, marketing and administrative functions (including human resources, legal, finance, quality assurance, compliance and general management) for compensation and benefits, travel, professional services, training and expenses for information technology and facilities. We also incur costs and expenses associated with depreciation and amortization.
In the first three months of 2023, approximately 30% of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which represents approximately 60 currencies. Because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in United States dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into United States dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results. As a result, we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. As such, the differences noted below between reported results of operations and constant currency information is wholly attributable to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
For information regarding our results of operations for Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, refer to “Segment Results of Operations” later in this section.
For the first quarter of 2023, our revenues increased $84 million, or 2.4%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately $166 million, or 4.7%, reflecting a $42 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $126 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, and a $2 million decrease in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.
The $75 million increase in cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 included a constant currency increase of approximately $185 million, or 8.0%, reflecting a $52 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $136 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, and a $3 million decrease in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.
The $25 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 included a constant currency increase of approximately $48 million, or 9.8%, reflecting a $19 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $7 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, a $1 million decrease in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, and a $23 million increase in general corporate and unallocated expenses.
Depreciation and amortization was relatively consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.
The restructuring costs incurred during 2023 and 2022 were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations and reduce overcapacity to adapt to changing market conditions and integrate acquisitions. The remaining actions under these plans are expected to occur throughout 2023 and into 2024 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements.
Interest income includes interest received primarily from bank balances and investments. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is primarily a result of higher deposit rates.Interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was higher than the same period in 2022 due primarily to higher base rate interest costs across the floating rate debt portfolio as well as from an increase in our net debt.
Other (income) expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased as compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to foreign currency gain and gains on investments.
Our effective income tax rate was 19.6% and 17.8% in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 was favorably impacted by $8 million and $13 million, respectively, as a result of excess tax benefits recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards.
Revenues and profit by segment are as follows:
Certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses. These costs primarily consist of stock-based compensation and expenses related to integration activities and acquisitions. We also do not allocate depreciation and amortization or impairment charges to our segments.

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements, equity repurchases, adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities, and access to the capital markets. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost-effective basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the United States and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.We had a cash balance of $1,494 million as of March 31, 2023 ($532 million of which was in the United States), an increase from $1,216 million as of December 31, 2022. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our debt arrangements, as well as market conditions, and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates. We may use our existing cash, cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses and/or proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations, to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also continually evaluate new acquisition, expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities, as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses, as appropriate, including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets. Should we elect to pursue any such transaction, we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities. Our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all.
As of March 31, 2023, the total stock repurchase authorization under the Company's equity repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) was $9,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased 0.7 million shares of our common stock for $129 million under the Repurchase Program. As of March 31, 2023, we have remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1,226 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program.
As of March 31, 2023, we had $13,222 million of total indebtedness, excluding $695 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of March 31, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with our restrictive covenants in all material respects.
As of March 31, 2023, the Company’s Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided financing through the senior secured credit facilities of up to $7,632 million, which consisted of $6,932 million principal amounts of debt outstanding, and $695 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit. On April 17, 2023, we increased the capacity of the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility by $500 million U.S. dollars, bringing the total capacity of the revolving credit facility to $2,000 million.
As of March 31, 2023, no additional amounts of revolving loan commitments were available under the receivables financing facility.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $91 million during the first three months of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash from unearned income ($95 million) and accounts receivable and unbilled services ($66 million) and from cash-related net income ($27 million), offset by an increase in cash from other operating assets and liabilities ($97 million).
Cash used in investing activities decreased $391 million during the first three months of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by less cash used for acquisitions of businesses ($412 million) and acquisitions of property, equipment and software ($13 million) and an increase in cash from other investing activities ($4 million), offset by more cash used in investments in debt and equity securities ($36 million), purchases of marketable securities, net ($1 million) and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, net ($1 million).
Cash provided by financing activities decreased $57 million during the first three months of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a decrease in cash proceeds from revolving credit facilities, net of repayments ($275 million), an increase in cash payments on contingent consideration and deferred purchase price accruals ($50 million) and debt and principal payments on finance leases ($15 million), offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock ($274 million) and cash payments related to employee stock option plans ($9 million).
