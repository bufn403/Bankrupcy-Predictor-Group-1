Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious. While the company highlights its position as a market leader and its efforts to adapt to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it also recognizes the ongoing threats and uncertainties associated with the situation.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided indicate mixed performance. Sales were flat or decreased slightly in some segments, with certain product categories experiencing declines due to the impact of COVID-19. Operating profit margins decreased, and there were additional costs related to the supply chain disruptions.

Step 3: The quarter experienced flat or slightly decreased revenue, with lower demand and operating profit margin declines due to incremental costs. The company expects demand to return but acknowledges uncertainty surrounding the timing, depending on the duration and scope of the pandemic.

Step 4: Combining the sentiment, performance figures, and future outlook, the company exhibits a medium risk of bankruptcy. While it has implemented measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and is in the process of a significant transaction with DuPont, the financial impact of ongoing disruptions and uncertainties poses a moderate level of risk.

Overall, the company's cautious sentiment, mixed financial performance, and uncertain outlook contribute to the assessment of medium risk.
