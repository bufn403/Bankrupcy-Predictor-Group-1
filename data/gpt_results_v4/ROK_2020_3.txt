Step 1: The management's discussion contains forward-looking statements regarding projected sales growth and earnings per share, highlighting uncertainties and risks beyond the company's control like pandemics, global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical factors. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company is emphasized, indicating potential adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations.

Step 2: 
- Sales Performance: The report outlines a decline in sales, such as the 7.1% decrease year over year in the sales in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This significant negative trend in sales reflects a challenging market environment.
- Operating Expenses: The report mentions efforts to manage costs through temporary and structural cost-saving initiatives, indicating potential financial constraints affecting the company's operations.
- Taxation: The effective tax rate increased, impacting net income, which can further strain the financial position.
- Cash Flows: While there was an increase in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, it was mainly due to incentive compensation payments and a legal settlement, rather than core operational improvements.

Step 3: The decline in sales, coupled with an increase in effective tax rates and operating costs, suggests that the company faced challenges in maintaining profitability. The reliance on non-operating factors like legal settlements for increases in net income raises concerns about the core financial health of the company.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy is evident due to the negative sales trends, increasing tax rates, and uncertainty in the business environment highlighted by the management. The reliance on one-time events for profitability rather than sustainable operational improvements indicates underlying financial fragility. The risks and uncertainties outlined may pose significant threats to the company's financial stability and viability in the future.
