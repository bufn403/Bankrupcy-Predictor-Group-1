Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 and uncertainty about future developments. For example, "There is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of disruption to our business that may result from COVID-19 and related governmental actions," indicating a level of concern.

Step 2: The company experienced a mixed quarter with decreased new orders in March and April but a strengthening demand for new homes from May to September. This was driven by historically low mortgage rates and low resale inventory levels. Additionally, the company saw increases in net income, gross profit margin, and homebuilding revenues compared to the previous year.

Step 3: While the third quarter showed positive growth in various financial aspects like net income and gross profit margin, the nine months ended in a decrease in homebuilding revenues due to the impact of the pandemic on settlements. The company's backlog also increased, but there are concerns about cancellations affecting backlog turnover rates.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, the mixed quarter results, and uncertainties about the future impact of COVID-19, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positive aspects like revenue growth and increased profit margins, the ongoing effects of the pandemic and potential cancellations pose risks that could impact the company's financial performance.
