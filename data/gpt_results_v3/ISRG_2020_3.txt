Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems to lean towards a mix of cautious optimism and acknowledgment of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company discusses their commitment to advancing patient care and innovation, they also highlight the significant impact of the pandemic on their operations and market. For example, "While total worldwide procedures per week have improved to near pre-COVID-19 procedure levels, procedure volumes vary by country, region, and type... It is possible that a growth or resurgence in COVID-19 infections will negatively impact da Vinci procedures." This indicates a level of uncertainty and potential challenges ahead.

- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The value of 0.403 indicates that the company has a positive working capital position, which is generally viewed as favorable for financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.307, this ratio shows a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to total assets, suggesting some level of financial strength.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to Total Assets ratio of 0.114 signifies the company's ability to generate earnings from its total assets, indicating a positive aspect of financial performance.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): This ratio of 0.461 indicates that the company is generating revenue in relation to its total assets, which is a positive sign for financial health.

Step 3: When combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting their procedure volumes and financial operations. While they maintain a positive working capital position and generate revenue, the uncertain impact of the pandemic on future operations poses a risk to the company's stability.

Step 4: Based on the cautious sentiment in the management's discussion, the moderate financial ratios, and the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
