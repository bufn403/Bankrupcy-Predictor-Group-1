Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously pessimistic. The discussion highlights a decrease in net income and income from operations compared to prior periods. It mentions increased expenses, such as stock-based compensation expenses, litigation costs, and a loss from operations. There are also concerns raised about the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce, economy, and financial markets globally.

Step 2:
- Revenues have increased year over year for both the three-month and nine-month periods, indicating some growth. However, factors like increased expenses, a decline in gross margin due to product mix, and lower-margin shipments negatively affected the income and operating results.
- The discussion also highlights an increase in stock-based compensation expenses, professional, consulting, and lobbying expenses related to litigation, and higher research and development expenses.
- The company reports a net loss for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, compared to net income in the prior year.

Step 3: Despite the increase in revenues, the company experienced a decline in income from operations and a net loss due to various factors mentioned, including increased expenses, product mix affecting gross margins, and higher costs related to COVID-19. The impacts of the pandemic, along with higher expenses and declining margins, suggest a challenging financial situation that may not improve in the near term.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The decrease in income, increase in expenses, and the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic indicate a financially precarious position for the company. The net losses, decline in gross margins, and uncertain economic conditions create a high risk of bankruptcy for the company in the foreseeable future.
