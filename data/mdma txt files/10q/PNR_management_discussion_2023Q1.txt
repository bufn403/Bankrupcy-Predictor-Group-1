The terms “us,” “we,” “our” or “Pentair” refer to Pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. At Pentair, we believe the health of our world depends on reliable access to clean water. We deliver a comprehensive range of smart, sustainable water solutions to homes, businesses and industries around the world. Our industry-leading and proven portfolio of solutions enables our customers to access clean, safe water; reduce water consumption; and recover and reuse water. Whether it’s improving, moving or helping people enjoy water, we help manage the world’s most precious resource. We are comprised of three reporting segments: Industrial & Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool. For the first three months of 2023, the Industrial & Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool segments represented approximately 38%, 26% and 36% of total revenues, respectively. We classify our operations into reporting segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served:•Industrial & Flow Technologies — The focus of this segment is to deliver water where it is needed, when it is needed and more efficiently and transforming waste into value. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a variety of fluid treatment and pump products and systems, including pressure vessels, gas recovery solutions, membrane bioreactors, wastewater reuse systems and advanced membrane filtration, separation systems, water disposal pumps, water supply pumps, fluid transfer pumps, turbine pumps, solid handling pumps, and agricultural spray nozzles, while serving the global residential, commercial and industrial markets. These products and systems are used in a range of applications, fluid delivery, ion exchange, desalination, food and beverage, separation technologies for the oil and gas industry, residential and municipal wells, water treatment, wastewater solids handling, pressure boosting, circulation and transfer, fire suppression, flood control, agricultural irrigation and crop spray.•Water Solutions — The focus of this segment is to provide great tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping end-users use water more productively. This segment designs, manufactures and sells commercial and residential water treatment products and systems including pressure tanks, control valves, activated carbon products, commercial ice machines, conventional filtration products, and point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment systems. These water treatment products and systems are used in residential whole home water filtration, drinking water filtration and water softening solutions in addition to commercial total water management and filtration in foodservice operations. In addition, our water solutions business also provides installation and preventative services for water management solutions for commercial operators.•Pool  — The focus of this segment is to provide innovative, energy efficient pool solutions to help end-users more sustainably enjoy water. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a complete line of energy-efficient residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories including pumps, filters, heaters, lights, automatic controls, automatic cleaners, maintenance equipment and pool accessories. Applications for our pool products include residential and commercial pool maintenance, pool repair, renovation, service and construction and aquaculture solutions.In July 2022, as part of our Water Solutions reporting segment, we acquired the issued and outstanding equity securities of certain subsidiaries of Welbilt, Inc. (“Welbilt”) and certain other assets, rights, and properties, and assumed certain liabilities, comprising Welbilt’s Manitowoc Ice business (“Manitowoc Ice”), for approximately $1.6 billion in cash.
The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in the first three months of 2023 and are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future:•During 2022 and the first three months of 2023, we executed certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of 2023 and to drive margin growth.•In 2021, we created a transformation office and launched and committed resources to the Transformation Program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion by driving operational excellence, reducing complexity and streamlining our processes. During 2022 and the first three months of 2023, we made strategic progress on our Transformation Program initiatives with a primary focus on two of our four key themes of pricing excellence and strategic sourcing and built capabilities across all themes, including the other two of operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. We  expect to continue to execute on our key Transformation Program initiatives during 2023 to drive margin expansion and continue to incur transformation costs throughout the remainder of 2023 and beyond.•During the first three months of 2023, we continued to experience supply chain challenges and inflationary cost increases of certain raw materials due to availability constraints and high demand. While we have taken pricing actions and implemented transformation initiatives that we expect to improve productivity and offset these cost increases, we expect supply chain pressures and inflationary cost increases to continue for the remainder of 2023, which may continue thereafter and could negatively impact our results of operations.•We have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue, both within and outside the U.S. We are reinforcing that our businesses more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these markets, our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline.•The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact global economic conditions. There are many uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the spread of increasing number of virus variants, the extent of worldwide social, political and economic disruption it may continue to cause and the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines to address the COVID-19 virus. The broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic that are reasonably likely to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows cannot be determined at this time, and ultimately will be affected by a number of evolving factors including the length of time that the pandemic continues and the impact of vaccines on it, the impact of virus variants, the effectiveness of vaccinations, the pandemic’s effect on the demand for our products and services, our supply chain, and our manufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as the impact of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic.In 2023, our operating objectives focus on delivering our core and building our future. We expect to execute these objectives by:•Delivering profitable revenue growth and productivity for customers and shareholders; •Continuing to focus on capital allocation through:◦Committing to maintain our investment grade rating; ◦Focusing on reducing our long-term debt;◦Returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and◦Accelerating our performance with strategically-aligned mergers and acquisitions;•Focusing growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital, technology and services expansion;•Continuing to implement our Transformation Program initiatives that will drive operational excellence, reduce complexity and improve our organizational structure; and•Building a high performance growth culture and delivering on our commitments while living our Win Right values.

The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three reportable segments (Industrial & Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool). Each of these segments is comprised of various product offerings that serve multiple end users.We evaluate performance based on net sales and segment income and use a variety of ratios to measure performance of our reporting segments. Segment income represents equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and operating income exclusive of intangible amortization, certain acquisition related expenses, costs of restructuring and transformation activities, impairments, legal accrual adjustments and settlements and other unusual non-operating items.

The majority of our backlog is short cycle in nature with shipments within one year from when a customer places an order and a substantial portion of our revenues has historically resulted from orders received and products delivered in the same month. A portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year from order to delivery depending on the size and type of order. We record, as part of our backlog, all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. Our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our 2023 net sales.The decrease in our overall backlog from December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by our Pool segment’s backlog trending down to more historical levels as a result of increased manufacturing capacity, improved lead times and customers balancing the need to place new orders with market demand and channel inventory levels.
We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private debt and equity offerings. Our primary revolving credit facility has generally been adequate for these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions. We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets. Consistent with historical trends, we experienced seasonal cash usage in the first quarter of 2023 and drew on our revolving credit facility to fund our operations.  This cash usage typically reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peak. We expect historical seasonal patterns to continue and the second quarter of 2023 to generate significant cash to fund our operations.  End-user demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and historically is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike typically is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperature, heavy flooding and droughts. We expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly. We believe our existing liquidity position, coupled with our currently anticipated operating cash flows, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months.
The $106.6 million in net cash used for operating activities in the first three months of 2023 primarily reflects $161.1 million of net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation, amortization and asset impairment. Additionally, we had a cash outflow of $262.6 million as a result of changes in net working capital, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable largely related to certain advance sale programs in anticipation of our distributors’ peak sales season in the second and third quarters.The $131.5 million in net cash used for operating activities in the first three months of 2022 primarily reflects $138.1 million of net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we had a cash outflow of $274.2 million as a result of changes in net working capital, primarily the result of increased accounts receivable and inventory balances along with lower employee compensation and benefits accruals compared to December 31, 2021. The change in the accounts receivable balance was due to higher sales during the last month of the first quarter of 2022 and timing of collections. The increased inventory balance was related to additional purchases to support existing orders. The lower employee compensation and benefits accruals were attributable to the payment of employee incentive compensation in the first quarter.
Net cash used for investing activities in the first three months of 2023 primarily reflects capital expenditures of $16.6 million.Net cash used for investing activities in the first three months of 2022 primarily reflects capital expenditures of $17.7 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of 2023 primarily relates to net borrowings of revolving long-term debt of $173.6 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $36.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of 2022 primarily relates to net borrowings of revolving long-term debt of $199.6 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $34.7 million and payments of debt issuance costs of $5.8 million.
In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that is equal to 100 percent conversion of net income. Free cash flow is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends, repurchase shares and repay debt. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow:
Pentair, Pentair Finance S.à r.l (“PFSA“) and Pentair, Inc. are parties to a credit agreement (the “Senior Credit Facility”), with Pentair as guarantor and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers, which was amended and restated in December 2021 and further amended in December 2022, providing for a $900.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $200.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 16, 2026 and the term loan facility has a maturity date of December 16, 2024. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, adjusted euro interbank offered rate, adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate or central bank rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA’s election, Pentair’s leverage level or PFSA’s public credit rating.As of March 31, 2023, total availability under the Senior Credit Facility was $406.4 million. In addition, PFSA has the option to request to increase the revolving credit facility and/or to enter into one or more additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $300.0 million, subject to customary conditions, including the commitment of the participating lenders.In March 2022, in contemplation of the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, Pentair and PFSA entered into a Loan Agreement among PFSA, as borrower, Pentair, as guarantor, and the lenders and agents party thereto, providing for a $600.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). In June 2022, the Term Loan Facility was amended to increase the facility by $400.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of July 28, 2027, with required quarterly installment payments of $6.3 million beginning on the last day of the third quarter of 2023 and increasing to $12.5 million beginning with the last day of the third quarter of 2024. The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, or adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA’s election, Pentair’s leverage level or PFSA’s public credit rating.In July 2022, in contemplation of the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, Pentair, as guarantor, and PFSA, as issuer, completed a public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.900% Senior Notes due 2032 (“2032 Senior Notes”). We used the net proceeds from the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of the 2032 Senior Notes to finance a portion of the Manitowoc Ice acquisition purchase price and to pay related fees and expenses.Our debt agreements contain various financial covenants, but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility contain covenants requiring us not to permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt (net of our consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $5.0 million but not to exceed $250.0 million) to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (each, a “testing period”) to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 (or, at PFSA’s election and subject to certain conditions, 4.25 to 1.00 for four testing periods in connection with certain material acquisitions) (the “Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense, for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility provide for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates.In addition to the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of $21.1 million, of which there were no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2023. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates.We have $18.8 million of Term Loan Facility payments due in the next twelve months. We classified this debt as long-term as of March 31, 2023 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a long-term basis under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Facility.As of March 31, 2023, we had $98.9 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences.
In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of $750.0 million. The authorization expires on December 31, 2025. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, no ordinary shares were repurchased. As of March 31, 2023, we had $600.0 million available for share repurchases under this authorization.
On February 20, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22, payable on May 5, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 21, 2023. As a result, the balance of dividends payable included in Other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $36.3 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $36.2 million at December 31, 2022. We paid dividends in the first three months of 2023 of $36.2 million, or $0.22 per ordinary share compared with $34.7 million, or $0.21 per ordinary share, in the prior year period. Under Irish law, the payment of future cash dividends and repurchases of shares may be paid only out of Pentair plc’s “distributable reserves” on its statutory balance sheet. Pentair plc is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the Irish High Court. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). Our distributable reserve balance was $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Pentair plc (the “Parent Company Guarantor”), fully and unconditionally, guarantees the senior notes of PFSA (the “Subsidiary Issuer”). The Subsidiary Issuer is a Luxembourg private limited liability company and 100 percent-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company Guarantor. The Parent Company Guarantor is a holding company established to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer is a holding company formed to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries and to issue debt securities, including the senior notes. The Parent Company Guarantor’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to make payments on the senior notes pursuant to the guarantees, is dividends from its subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer’s principal source of cash flow is interest income from its subsidiaries. None of the subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer is under any direct obligation to pay or otherwise fund amounts due on the senior notes or the guarantees, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, there may be statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends from certain subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer. If such subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer may not be able to make principal and interest payments on their outstanding debt, including the senior notes or the guarantees.The following table presents summarized financial information as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for the Parent Company Guarantor and Subsidiary Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor or issuer.
The Parent Company Guarantor and Subsidiary Issuer do not have material results of operations on a combined basis.
We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
