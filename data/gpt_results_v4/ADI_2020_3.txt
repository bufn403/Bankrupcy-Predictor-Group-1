Step 1: The management's discussion contains a cautious tone, especially considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. There's uncertainty around the full extent of the pandemic's impact on the business, with modifications to business practices and potential future actions necessitated by the evolving situation.

Step 2:
- Revenue Decrease: The company experienced a decrease in revenue across all end markets, primarily due to lower demand for products and supply constraints related to COVID-19. This significant drop in revenue indicates operational challenges and market uncertainties.
- Gross Margin Decrease: The gross margin percentage decreased, driven by lower utilization of factories due to decreased customer demand and temporary shutdowns in response to the pandemic. This decline highlights operational inefficiencies and financial strain.
- Operating Expenses: Research and development (R&D) and selling, marketing, general, and administrative (SMG&A) expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending in response to the pandemic. While cost-cutting is prudent, it may also indicate potential constraints on necessary investments.

Step 3: The company faced significant challenges, including lower revenue, decreased gross margins, and uncertainty regarding the impact of the pandemic on operations and financial performance. Cost-cutting measures were evident but could impact future growth and innovation. The reliance on cash generated from operations and continued access to debt markets for liquidity might indicate financial pressure.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial performance has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to revenue decreases and reduced gross margins. While cost-control measures have been implemented, there are concerns about the ability to sustain operations, especially if the pandemic situation worsens or if market conditions do not improve. The uncertainty and financial strain suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy in the near future.
