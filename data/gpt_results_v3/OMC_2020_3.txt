Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic. The text highlights the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's revenue, the cost-cutting measures taken, and the uncertainty about future performance. For example, the text mentions, "we expect that we will have negative organic growth and an overall decline in revenue for 2020" and "there can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions will be effective."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0307 - A negative working capital to total assets ratio indicates potential financial distress, as it suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets. This can pose challenges for meeting short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.377 - A relatively high retained earnings to total assets ratio indicates a healthy level of profits reinvested into the business, which can act as a cushion against financial downturns.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0787 - The EBIT to total assets ratio reflects the company's profitability in relation to its total assets. A positive value indicates profitability, but the specific value should be compared to industry benchmarks for a better assessment.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.5239 - This ratio shows how efficiently the company is utilizing its assets to generate revenue. A higher value suggests better asset utilization.

Step 3: The combination of the pessimistic outlook in the management discussion, the negative working capital to total assets ratio, and the indication of a revenue decline in the financial text implies a challenging quarter. The cost-cutting measures taken to align the cost structure with reduced revenue also indicate a strain on the company's financial performance.

Step 4: The company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company has some positive aspects like a relatively high retained earnings to total assets ratio, the overall impact of the pandemic on revenue, the negative working capital ratio, and the uncertainties regarding future performance lead to this classification. The company faces financial challenges that warrant attention and proactive measures to improve its financial health.
