Step 1: The management's discussion in the filing provides a comprehensive overview of the company's operations, revenue sources, and strategic initiatives, reflecting a balanced perspective. The document acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business' operations, including the transition to working from home, while highlighting increased consumer engagement with its products during business closures due to the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Revenue Streams: The company generates revenue from the sale of internally developed software titles and titles developed by third parties through various platforms and distribution channels.
- Net Bookings: This key metric reflects the net amount of products and services sold digitally or physically during the period. While Net Bookings decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2020, the nine months ended December 31, 2020, saw an increase, driven by various franchises and new releases.
- Gross Profit: The company reported an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue due to lower costs associated with software amortization and internal royalties.

Step 3: The financial performance of the company exhibits fluctuations in key performance indicators such as Net Bookings and Gross Profit, influenced by the timing of product releases and consumer engagement, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are positive aspects like the growth of Net Bookings and an increase in Gross Profit percentage, there are also areas of concern such as fluctuations in net revenue and operating expenses.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's mixed financial performance, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, indicates a level of vulnerability that warrants attention. The fluctuations in revenue, increasing operating expenses, and reliance on limited customers pose risks to the company's financial stability. The potential effects of economic downturns and the uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic could further challenge the company's financial health, placing it at a moderate risk of bankruptcy.
