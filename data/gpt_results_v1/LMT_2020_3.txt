Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion section is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but highlighting proactive efforts taken by the company and the U.S. Government to mitigate disruptions. For example, "Despite these challenges, Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Governmentâ€™s proactive efforts, especially with regard to the supply chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions caused by COVID-19 on our operations" shows a level of cautious optimism.

Step 2: The company expects its 2020 net sales to increase to approximately $65.3 billion and forecasts a total business segment operating profit margin of approximately 10.9%. This positive outlook is supported by statements like, "We have experienced impacts in each of our business areas related to COVID-19...favorable contract award timing, strong operational performance...partially offset the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial results."

Step 3: Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company has shown resilience in maintaining its operations and adapting to the situation. The text mentions, "Our work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic" and "Our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism."

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the face of the pandemic challenges, the positive outlook on net sales and profit margins, and the company's adaptability during the crisis, it can be inferred that Lockheed Martin has a low risk of bankruptcy in the near future. The proactive measures taken to navigate the challenges and the positive financial projections indicate a level of stability in the company's operations.
