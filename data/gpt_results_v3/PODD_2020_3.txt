Decision: Medium

Step 1: The sentiment in the Management Discussion Text appears to be optimistic. The company discusses their focus on strategic imperatives such as delivering consumer-focused innovation, expanding globally, and driving operational excellence. They also mention their long-term financial objective of sustaining profitable growth. This positive outlook suggests a lower risk of bankruptcy.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.437 indicates a moderate level, showing that the company has a reasonable amount of working capital relative to its total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.146 indicates negative retained earnings in relation to total assets, which could be a concern as it signifies that the company's losses have eroded its assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0969 indicates a positive EBIT to total assets ratio, which reflects the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.6557 shows a high total revenue to total assets ratio, indicating that the company is effectively utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: The combination of financial ratios and the optimistic outlook in the Management Discussion Text suggests a somewhat stable financial position. However, the negative Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio raises concerns about the company's profitability. The positive EBIT to Total Assets ratio and high Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio indicate operational efficiency and revenue generation capabilities.

Step 4: Considering the overall analysis, the company appears to be in a relatively stable position with some concerning aspects, particularly the negative Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio. Therefore, the conclusion is medium risk.
