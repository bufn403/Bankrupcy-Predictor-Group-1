Step 1: The management's discussion conveys a mix of optimism regarding the company's activities, such as significant discoveries in offshore locations, and caution due to challenges faced, most notably the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the decrease in oil demand that followed.

Step 2: 
- Cost Reduction Initiatives: The company significantly reduced its E&P capital budget in response to reduced demand and lower oil prices, shifting from a six-rig program to one rig in Bakken and deferring discretionary spending.
- Asset Sales: The company entered into agreements to sell its interest in the Shenzi Field for financial gain, indicating efforts to shore up liquidity.
- Hedging Activities: The company engaged in hedging activities to manage the impact of fluctuating oil prices, demonstrating a proactive approach to risk management.

Step 3: The company faced substantial challenges from the global pandemic and the resulting reduction in oil demand, leading to decreased net sales, production, and income. Despite efforts to mitigate these challenges through cost reductions, asset sales, and hedging activities, the financial results and operational performance were adversely affected, as seen in the net loss incurred and reduced cash flow from operating activities in the reported period.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The significant impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the decline in oil demand, and the resulting financial strain reflected in lower net sales, reduced production, and notable net losses indicate a high risk of bankruptcy. While the company has taken some measures to preserve cash and manage liquidity, the challenges posed by the current economic environment may continue to jeopardize the company's financial stability in the future.
