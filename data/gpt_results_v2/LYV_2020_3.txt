High

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion section is pessimistic. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the company's operations, leading to a drastic decrease in revenue and a shift from operating income to operating loss. One quote supporting this is, "The pandemic led to an operating loss for the quarter of $504 million compared to operating income of $260 million for the third quarter of last year."

Step 2: The relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion show a significant decline in revenue across all segments, such as a 95% decrease in overall revenue for the quarter and an 81% decrease for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the previous year. One quote supporting this is, "Our total revenue decreased by $7.0 billion, or 81%, as compared to last year."

Step 3: The numbers and figures represent a failed quarter due to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The conditions are unlikely to improve soon, as indicated by the statement, "Currently, we do not anticipate a significant change in activity levels through next year."

Step 4: Considering the pessimistic sentiment, the significant declines in revenue, and the uncertain future outlook, it is determined that the company has a high risk of bankruptcy. The company's inability to generate revenue at pre-pandemic levels and uncertainty about the recovery timeline contribute to this high risk assessment.
