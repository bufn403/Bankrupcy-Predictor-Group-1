Step 1: The company's management discussion reflects a cautious outlook due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations and financial performance. They mention substantial changes made to adapt to the pandemic, such as temporary closures of locations globally, significant investment in R&D, and the implementation of cost-saving measures to preserve liquidity.

Step 2: 
- Orders: There was a 4% decrease in total orders for the three months ended July 31, 2020 compared to the same period last year, highlighting reduced demand.
- Net Revenue: A 7% and 6% decrease in net revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2020 compared to the same periods last year indicates a decline in sales.
- Net Income: While net income increased for the three months ended July 31, 2020, it decreased for the nine months ended July 31, 2020, primarily due to lower revenue volume from site closures and supply chain disruptions.
- Tax Rate: The company's effective tax rate fluctuated, with a lower rate for the three months ended July 31, 2020 compared to the same period last year, impacted by various factors such as U.S. federal R&D credits.

Step 3: The company faced challenges with decreasing orders and net revenue, primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on their operations and supply chain disruptions. While cost-saving measures and investments in R&D were made to mitigate the effects, the decline in financial metrics, especially the lower net income for the nine months ended July 31, 2020, indicates ongoing financial strain.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The declining orders and net revenue, along with fluctuating financial performance due to COVID-19 disruptions, suggest financial instability. While the company took proactive cost-saving measures and made investments in R&D, the ongoing challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic could pose a significant risk to the company's financial health in the future.
