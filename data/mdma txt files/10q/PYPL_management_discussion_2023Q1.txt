We are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person payments.
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) formally exited the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) with the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020. PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport permissions (as they stood at the end of the transition period) under the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new U.K. authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. We are currently unable to determine the longer-term impact that Brexit will have on our business, which will depend, in part, on the implications of new tariff, trade, and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of cross-border goods and services between the U.K. and the EEA, as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for PayPal to obtain new U.K. authorizations to operate its business longer-term within the U.K. market. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10‑Q.Brexit may contribute to instability in financial, stock, and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro. We have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements. The tables below provide the percentage of our total net revenues and gross loans and interest receivable from the U.K. and EU for the periods presented:
The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around the duration and severity of the coronavirus pandemic, the Russia and Ukraine conflict, supply chain shortages, a recession globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest rates, and other related global economic conditions, remain unknown. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of lower consumer spending, merchant and consumer bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may adversely impact our business. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future financial and operating results.
The following table provides a summary of our condensed consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:

Net revenues increased $557 million, or 9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 10%. Total operating expenses increased $269 million, or 5%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent, an increase in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and development expense.Operating income increased by $288 million, or 41%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net revenues growing faster than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 14% and 11% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.Net income increased $286 million, or 56%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of $288 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $157 million driven primarily by higher interest income due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $159 million driven primarily by higher tax expense on higher income before taxes and discrete tax adjustments.
We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar versus the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately 41% and 43% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S. in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded (if applicable) below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.
We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.In the three months ended March 31, 2023, year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:
While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.We also use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.Additionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.
TPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:•TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. •Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
•An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.•Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.As our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.
Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We earn additional fees from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.•Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
The components of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction revenues grew by $366 million, or 6%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth in TPV (in particular growth in our unbranded card processing volume, which consists primarily of our Braintree products and services) and the number of payment transactions on our payments platform. The growth in transaction revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was partially offset by a decline in revenues from our core PayPal products and services, including fee revenue from foreign exchange. The graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:
*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period.The following table provides a summary of related metrics:
** Not meaningfulWe had active accounts of 433 million and 429 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 1%. Our total number of payment transactions was 5.8 billion and 5.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 13%. TPV was $355 billion and $323 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 10%.
Transaction revenues grew more slowly than growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to a decline in revenues from core PayPal products and services and foreign currency exchange fees.
Revenues from other value added services increased $191 million, or 39%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily attributable to increases in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from higher interest rates and interest and fee revenue on our loans receivable portfolio driven by consumer interest-bearing installment loans and our PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products.
The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each:
(1) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV.  (2) Transaction and credit loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and credit losses by TPV.  ** Not meaningful.
Transaction expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in millions):
Transaction expense increased by $466 million, or 17%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to the 10% increase in TPV for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and unfavorable changes in product mix. The increase in the transaction expense rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year was also attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher expense rates than other products and services, partially offset by favorable impacts resulting from certain third-party pricing reductions and favorable changes in regional mix with respect to our core PayPal products. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 35% and 36% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products.
The components of our transaction and credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction and credit losses increased by $73 million, or 20%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year. Transaction losses were $300 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $322 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $22 million, or 7%. Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 0.10% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in transaction losses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to benefits from risk mitigation strategies particularly with our Venmo products. Credit losses increased by $95 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year. The components of credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
(1) Net charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables. (2) Reserve build (release) represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement.
The provision in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding. The provision in the three months ended March 31, 2022 was attributable to loan originations in that period, partially offset by improvements in the credit quality of loans outstanding and a reduction in the volatility of model inputs representing current and projected macroeconomic conditions at that time. During the periods presented, allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios included qualitative adjustments that took into account uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions and around the financial health of our borrowers, including the effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants in previous years.The consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $6.1 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, net of participation interest sold, representing a year-over-year increase of 47% driven by the expansion of our installment credit products. Approximately 36% and 48% of our consumer loans receivable outstanding as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The decline in the percentage of consumer loans receivable outstanding in the U.K. at March 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2022 was due to overall growth in the consumer loan receivables portfolio, particularly from installment credit products in other markets including Germany, the U.S., and Japan.The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:
(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.(2) Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the period.We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of March 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2022, representing a year-over-year increase of 33%. The increase in merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding was due primarily to growth in our PayPal Business Loan products in the U.S. Approximately 84% and 5% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of March 31, 2023 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as compared to 83% and 7%, respectively, as of March 31, 2022.The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:
(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.(2) Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance during the period.The decrease in the percent of current merchant receivables, increase in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding, and increase in the net charge-off rate for merchant receivables at March 31, 2023 as compared to March 31, 2022 were primarily due to the expansion of acceptable risk parameters in 2022, which resulted in a decline in the overall credit quality of loans outstanding.We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment. During the first quarter of 2023, in response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented which resulted in reduced PPBL originations in the quarter. Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters for our consumer credit products did not have a material impact on our consumer loans in the periods presented.
Customer support and operations expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Customer support and operations expenses decreased by $46 million, or 9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023,  compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs, customer onboarding and compliance costs, and contractors and consulting costs.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $158 million, or 27%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to lower spending on marketing campaigns and targeted user incentives and decline in employee-related costs.
Technology and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Technology and development expenses decreased by $94 million, or 12%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decline in costs related to contractors, consultants, and cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products and services along with lower intangible amortization in the current period.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
General and administrative expenses decreased by $100 million, or 16%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decrease in employee-related expenses driven by a decline in stock-based compensation expense.
Restructuring and other charges for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Restructuring and other charges increased by $128 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year.
During the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $117 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, substantially all of which have been accrued for as of March 31, 2023. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce was approximately $280 million, including approximately $85 million in stock-based compensation. We expect to reinvest a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive business priorities.During the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated restructuring charges during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $20 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.
Additionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of $39 million and $16 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements. We also incurred a loss of $8 million upon designation of an owned property as held for sale in the three months ended March 31, 2023.
Other income (expense), net increased $157 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher interest income resulting from an increase in interest rates. Other income (expense), net in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was also positively impacted by foreign exchange gains in the current period compared to losses in the prior period primarily from actions taken in connection with our decision to suspend transactional services in Russia, and higher net gains on strategic investments. These factors favorably impacting other income (expense), net were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due in part to incremental expense from our May 2022 fixed rate debt.
Our effective income tax rate was 26% and 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in tax benefits associated with discrete tax adjustments and an increase in tax expense associated with higher net gains on strategic investments.
We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.
The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:March 31, 2023December 31, 2022(In millions)Cash, cash equivalents, and investments(1),(2)$13,059 $13,723 (1) Excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $35.3 billion and $36.4 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $13 million and $17 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and strategic investments of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.9 billion at March 31, 2023 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022, or 68% and 62% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2022, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income or the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes.
The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:
(1) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Refer to “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional information.
The net cash generated from operating activities of $1.2 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due primarily to operating income of $1.0 billion, as well as adjustments for non-cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $442 million, stock-based compensation of $345 million, and depreciation and amortization of $270 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of $240 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period, and changes in income taxes payable of $235 million.The net cash generated from operating activities of $1.2 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due primarily to operating income of $711 million, as well as adjustments for non-cash expenses including stock-based compensation of $429 million, provision for transaction and credit losses of $369 million, and depreciation and amortization of $328 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of $391 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses during the period.In the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, cash paid for income taxes, net was $495 million and $47 million, respectively.
The net cash provided by investing activities of $34 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due primarily to principal repayment of loans receivable of $8.1 billion, maturities and sales of investments of $5.4 billion, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.1 billion, offset by purchases and originations of loans receivable of $8.3 billion, purchases of investments of $6.1 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $170 million. The net cash used in investing activities of $752 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $8.6 billion, purchases and originations of loans receivable of $5.5 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of $239 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $191 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $8.8 billion and principal repayment of loans receivable of $5.1 billion.
The net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due primarily to the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.0 billion, tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $149 million, and changes in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net of $129 million. The net cash used in financing activities of $669 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due primarily to the repurchase of $1.5 billion of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program, tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $244 million, and repayment of borrowings under a prior credit agreement of $104 million,  partially offset by changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $863 million and borrowings under our Paidy credit agreements of $286 million.
Foreign currency exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2023 had a negative impact of $4 million on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due primarily to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar partially offset by the impact of favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Euro. Foreign currency exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2022 had a positive impact of $18 million on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due primarily to the favorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar partially offset by the impact of unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Russian ruble and Japanese yen.
In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of ¥60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of ¥90.0 billion (approximately $678 million as of March 31, 2023.) As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, ¥73.3 billion (approximately $553 million) and ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million), respectively, were outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement. At March 31, 2023, ¥16.7 billion (approximately $125 million) of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. Other than as described above, there were no significant changes to the available credit and debt disclosed in our 2022 Form 10‑K. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital.We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of March 31, 2023, we had a total of $3.8 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.8 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.
As of March 31, 2023, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.
Our material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.
Growth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We are currently evaluating partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products. In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European and U.S. credit activities. In August 2022, the CSSF approved PayPal’s management designating up to 50% of such balances to fund our credit activities through the end of February 2023. In February 2023, the CSSF agreed that PayPal’s management may continue to designate up to 50% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of March 31, 2023, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated to fund credit activities aggregated to $3.8 billion and represented approximately 39% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use at that date, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal.
The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.08% and 0.10% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase programs authorized in July 2018 and June 2022. As of March 31, 2023, a total of approximately $14.4 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.
Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q, as well as “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.
