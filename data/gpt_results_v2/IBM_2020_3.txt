Low Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is optimistic, focusing on IBM's future plans and capabilities. For example, "IBM is redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company" and "The pandemic has driven companies to accelerate their digital transformations."
Step 2: The relevant numbers and figures provided point to a successful quarter, with revenue of $17.6 billion, income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion, and operating earnings of $2.3 billion. The company generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion through dividends.
Step 3: Despite a decrease in total revenue by 2.6%, the company's cloud revenue grew 19% in the third quarter of 2020. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin increased, and total expense decreased, showing efficiency in operations.
Step 4: Given the optimism in management's discussion, the successful quarter results, and the focus on future growth with the separation plan, IBM demonstrates a low risk of bankruptcy as it navigates through the challenges posed by the pandemic and continues to innovate in cloud and AI technologies. The company's financial stability, strong balance sheet, and liquidity position further support the low-risk assessment.
