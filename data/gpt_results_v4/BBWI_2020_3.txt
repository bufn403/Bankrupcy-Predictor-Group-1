Step 1: The management's discussion acknowledges the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance, including disruption of global supply chains, reduced customer traffic, and delays in manufacturing and shipping. The discussion emphasizes taking steps to improve performance at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, such as store closures, expense reductions, and managing inventory diligently. While the company has taken prudent actions to navigate the crisis, the overall tone is cautious and highlights challenges faced due to the pandemic.

Step 2:
- Operating Income: The operating income in the third quarter of 2020 increased significantly, driven mainly by higher net sales at Bath & Body Works offsetting a decrease at Victoria's Secret.
- Net Sales: Bath & Body Works saw a substantial increase in net sales, while Victoria's Secret experienced a decline due to changing consumer behaviors and store closures.
- Gross Profit: The gross profit for Bath & Body Works improved due to increased merchandise margin dollars, while Victoria's Secret experienced lower gross profit due to store closures impacting sales.

Step 3: The financial figures indicate a mixed performance with Bath & Body Works showing strength in net sales and profitability, while Victoria's Secret facing challenges with decreasing sales. The company's operations were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to store closures, reduced consumer spending, and disruptions in the supply chain. While the company took various cost-cutting measures and strategic actions to enhance performance, the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and its ongoing impact on operations signal a high risk of bankruptcy.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. Despite some positive aspects like the increased net sales at Bath & Body Works and cost-saving initiatives, the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance, particularly at Victoria's Secret, creates a high risk of bankruptcy. The challenges posed by store closures, reduced traffic, and ongoing uncertainties from the pandemic significantly weigh on the company's financial outlook.
