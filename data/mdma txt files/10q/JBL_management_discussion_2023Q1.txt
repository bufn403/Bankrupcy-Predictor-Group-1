We are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products. We derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as “manufacturing services”), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend for the foreseeable future, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue, which in turn depends upon their growth, viability and financial stability. We conduct our operations in facilities that are located worldwide, including but not limited to, China, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. We derived a substantial majority, 84.0% and 85.0%, of net revenue from our international operations for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively. Our global manufacturing production sites allow customers to manufacture products simultaneously in the optimal locations for their products. Our global presence is key to assessing and executing on our business opportunities.We have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (“DMS”), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and networking and storage industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. Our DMS segment includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, connected devices, healthcare and packaging, and mobility industries.We monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change.Refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 for further discussion of the items disclosed in Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section as of February 28, 2023 contained herein.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, significant impacts in countries where we operate. Travel and business operation restrictions arising from governmental virus containment efforts have continued to impact our operations in Asia during this fiscal year. Certain of our suppliers continue to experience supply chain constraints, including difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill customer production requirements and challenges in transporting completed products to our end customers.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain key operating results and other financial information (in millions, except per share data):
Management regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the Company’s operating results. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on the effective management of our sales cycle as well as timing of payments. Our sales cycle measures how quickly we can convert our manufacturing services into cash through sales. We believe the metrics set forth below are useful to investors in measuring our liquidity as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable.The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of management’s key financial performance indicators:
(1)The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter was a direct result of changes in these indicators.(2)Inventory turns (annualized) are calculated as 360 days divided by days in inventory. (3)Days in accounts receivable is calculated as accounts receivable, net, divided by net revenue multiplied by 90 days. (4)Days in inventory is calculated as inventories, net and contract assets divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended February 28, 2023, the increase in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter and the three months ended February 28, 2022, was primarily due to higher raw material balances related to supply chain constraints, particularly in the automotive supply chain.(5)Days in accounts payable is calculated as accounts payable divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended February 28, 2023, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to an increase in material purchases and timing of payments during the quarter. During the three months ended February 28, 2023, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the three months ended February 28, 2022, was primarily due to cash payments and timing of purchases during the quarter.
The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 — “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.
See Note 18 – “New Accounting Guidance” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.
Generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.The distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.
Net revenue increased during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022. Specifically, the DMS segment net revenue increased 8% due to: (i) a 6% increase in revenues from existing customers within our automotive and transportation business, (ii) a 5% increase in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business, and (iii) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our healthcare and packaging business. The increase is partially offset by a 7% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our connected devices business. The EMS segment net revenue increased 7% due to: (i) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and capital equipment business, (ii) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our digital print and retail business, and (iii) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our networking and storage business. The increase is partially offset by a 1% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our 5G, wireless and cloud business.Net revenue increased during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. Specifically, the EMS segment net revenue increased 13% due to: (i) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and capital equipment business, (ii) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our digital print and retail business, (iii) a 3% increase in revenues from existing customers within our networking and storage business, and (iv) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our 5G, wireless and cloud business. The DMS segment net revenue increased 8% due to: (i) a 7% increase in revenues from existing customers within our automotive and transportation business, (ii) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our healthcare and packaging business, and (iii) a 1% increase in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business. The increase is partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our connected devices business.We continue to expect $800 million in components that we procure and integrate for our cloud business will shift from a purchase and resale model to a customer-controlled consignment service model during fiscal year 2023. As a result of this continued transition, revenue associated with these components are shown on a net basis and as a result, we expect higher gross margins and lower cash used in this business.The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, foreign source revenue expressed as a percentage of net revenue:

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022. The increase is primarily due to a $4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to awards granted during the three months ended November 30, 2022.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase is primarily due to a $11 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to higher anticipated achievement levels for certain performance-based stock awards and awards granted during the three months ended November 30, 2022.
Research and development expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net revenue during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022.
Amortization of intangibles remained relatively consistent during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022.
Restructuring, severance and related charges increased during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022 primarily related to a headcount reduction to further optimize our business activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022.
The change in other expense (income) during the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022, is primarily due to: (i) $15 million related to an increase in fees associated with the securitization programs and higher utilization of and higher interest rates for the trade accounts receivable sales programs, (ii) $4 million primarily related to higher net periodic benefit costs, and (iii) $2 million arising from an increase in other expense. The change in other expense (income) during the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022, is primarily due to: (i) $31 million related to an increase in fees associated with the securitization programs and higher utilization of and higher interest rates for the trade accounts receivable programs, and (ii) $7 million primarily related to higher net periodic benefit costs. The change is partially offset by $3 million arising from a decrease in other expense.
Interest income increased during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates on cash equivalents (investments that are readily convertible to cash with maturity dates of 90 days or less).
Interest expense increased during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates on our commercial paper program and credit facilities.

The effective income tax rate differed for the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months and six months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to: (i) a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, driven in part by restructuring charges for the six months ended February 28, 2023 and (ii) a $10 million income tax benefit associated with the reversal of a non-U.S. partial valuation allowance during the three months ended February 28, 2023.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliations below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP “core” financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. Also, our “core” financial measures should not be construed as an indication by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our “core” financial measures.For fiscal year 2023, the Company adopted an annual normalized tax rate (“normalized core tax rate”) for the computation of the non-GAAP (core) income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. In estimating the normalized core tax rate annually, the Company utilizes a full-year financial projection of core earnings that considers the mix of earnings across tax jurisdictions, existing tax positions, and other significant tax matters. The Company may adjust the normalized core tax rate during the year for material impacts from new tax legislation or material changes to the Company’s operations. Prior to fiscal year 2023, the Company determined the tax effect of the items included and excluded from core earnings quarterly.Included in the tables below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:
(1)Recorded during the six months ended February 28, 2023, related to headcount reduction to further optimize our business activities.(2)We are reclassifying the pension components in other expense to core operating income as we assess operating performance, inclusive of all components of net periodic benefit cost, with the related revenue. There is no impact to core earnings or diluted core earnings per share for this adjustment.
(1)Certain customers co-invest in property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) with us. As we acquire PP&E, we recognize the cash payments in acquisition of PP&E. When our customers reimburse us and obtain control, we recognized the cash receipts in proceeds and advances from the sale of PP&E.
We believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our global asset-backed securitization program and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any share repurchases under the approved programs, any potential acquisitions, our working capital requirements and our contractual obligations for the next 12 months and beyond. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash.
As of February 28, 2023, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which a significant portion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Most of our foreign cash and cash equivalents as of February 28, 2023 could be repatriated to the United States without potential tax expense.
Following is a summary of principal debt payments and debt issuance for our notes payable and credit facilities:
(1)On February 10, 2023, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our senior unsecured credit agreement dated as of January 22, 2020 (as amended, the “Credit Facility”). The Amendment, among other things, (i) instituted certain amendments to the sustainability-linked adjustments to the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility (the “Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility”) and the five-year revolving credit facility (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) established customary SOFR, CDOR, EURIBOR and TIBOR provisions, which replaced the LIBOR provisions set forth in the existing agreement, and (iii) extended the termination date of the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility to January 22, 2025, and of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility to January 22, 2027.(2)As of February 28, 2023, we had $3.8 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. The Credit Facility acts as the back-up facility for commercial paper outstanding, if any. We have a borrowing capacity of up to $3.2 billion under our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings with an original maturity of 90 days or less are recorded net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and have been excluded from the table above.We have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.Our Senior Notes and our credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 5 – “Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Certain Jabil entities participating in the global asset-backed securitization program continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. In addition, a foreign entity participating in the global asset-backed securitization program sells certain receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a daily basis.We continue servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receive a servicing fee under the global asset-backed securitization program. Servicing fees related to the global asset-backed securitization program recognized during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 were not material. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate that the fee we receive to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.The special purpose entity in the global asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering up to the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the domestic, or U.S., portion of the global asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of February 28, 2023.
The global asset-backed securitization program expires on November 25, 2024 and the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time is $600 million. During the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, we sold $1.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of trade accounts receivable and we received cash proceeds of $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. As of February 28, 2023, we had no available liquidity under our global asset-backed securitization program.
The global asset-backed securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under our global asset-backed securitization program. Refer to Note 6 – “Asset-Backed Securitization Program” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the program.
As of February 28, 2023, we may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financial institutions may elect to purchase specific accounts receivable at any one time up to a: (i) maximum aggregate amount available of $2.1 billion under nine trade accounts receivable sale programs, (ii) maximum amount available of 400 million CNY under one trade accounts receivable sale program and (iii) maximum amount available of 100 million CHF under one trade accounts receivable sale program. The trade accounts receivable sale programs expire on various dates through 2025.
During the three months and six months ended February 28, 2023, we sold $2.9 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $2.9 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. As of February 28, 2023, we had up to $1.3 billion in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.
The following table sets forth selected consolidated cash flow information (in millions):
Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2023, was primarily due to non-cash expenses and net income and a decrease in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, contract assets. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets. The decrease in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of collections. The decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments. The decrease in contract assets is primarily due to timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. The increase in inventories is primarily due to higher raw material balances related to supply chain constraints, particularly in the automotive supply chain. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to the timing of payments.
Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended February 28, 2023 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, principally to support ongoing business in the DMS and EMS segments, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily due to (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, (iii) the purchase of treasury stock under employee stock plans, and (iv) dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by borrowings under debt agreements.
For Fiscal Year 2023, we anticipate our net capital expenditures will be approximately $875 million. In general, our capital expenditures support ongoing maintenance in our DMS and EMS segments and investments in capabilities and targeted end markets. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things.
We currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and global economic conditions.In July 2021, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock (the “2022 Share Repurchase Program”). As of February 28, 2023, 16.5 million shares had been repurchased for $1.0 billion and no authorization remains under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program.In September 2022, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”). As of February 28, 2023, 0.3 million shares had been repurchased for $25 million and $975 million remains available under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program.
As of the date of this report, other than the new operating and finance leases, (see Note 4 – “Leases” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business, since August 31, 2022, to our contractual obligations and commitments and the related cash requirements.
