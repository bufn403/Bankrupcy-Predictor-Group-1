Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While the company acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and the global economy, it also highlights its efforts to adapt and mitigate challenges. For example, the company states, "We have applied those changing requirements to our business to maintain the health and safety of our employees and serve our customers consistent with appropriate public health considerations." This shows a proactive approach to addressing the pandemic's effects.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.56 indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital in relation to its total assets. This suggests some ability to cover short-term liabilities.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.57 demonstrates a decent portion of earnings being retained within the company relative to its total assets, indicating some level of financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.12 shows a moderate level of earnings before interest and taxes in relation to total assets, which may signify some profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.08 implies that the company is generating more revenue relative to its total assets, which could be a positive indicator of asset utilization efficiency.

Step 3: When combining the sentiment of the management's discussion with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is managing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well. The financial ratios suggest a decent level of working capital, retained earnings, earnings before interest and taxes, and revenue generation efficiency, which are positive signs for financial health. The company's efforts to adapt to the current situation and maintain operations also contribute to a stable outlook.

Step 4: Considering the overall sentiment, financial ratios, and the company's proactive measures, the assessment points towards a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positive indicators such as asset utilization efficiency and financial stability through retained earnings, there are still economic uncertainties due to the pandemic that could impact future performance. The company appears to be in a reasonably stable position currently but may face challenges depending on the duration and severity of the ongoing global crisis.
