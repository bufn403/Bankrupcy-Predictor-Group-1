Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and acknowledges the challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The text states, "Given the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, and the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic... we expect that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020 and potentially beyond." This indicates a recognition of the significant challenges ahead.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.225 implies that the company's working capital is relatively low compared to total assets, which can indicate liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.248 suggests that a significant portion of the company's assets is not retained earnings, potentially affecting financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.178 shows that the company's earnings before interest and taxes in relation to total assets are not very high, which could impact profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.425 indicates that the company generates revenue relative to its total assets, but other factors like expenses can influence overall financial health.

Step 3: Combining the cautionary tone of the management's discussion with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and financial stability due to the ongoing pandemic. The lower working capital, retained earnings, and EBIT in relation to total assets suggest a strain on the company's financial health. The impact of the pandemic on store closures, reduced sales, and increased expenses further adds to the financial challenges faced.

Step 4: Based on the cautious sentiment expressed in the management's discussion and the financial ratios indicating potential financial strain, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The combination of the factors suggests a challenging quarter and uncertain future outlook, warranting careful monitoring of financial health and risk mitigation strategies.
