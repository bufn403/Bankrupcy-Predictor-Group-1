Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic, focusing on the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial results, operations, and future outlook.
Quote: "Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of such travel and restaurant-related services. Our results for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 have been significantly and negatively impacted... The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions...have resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and an unprecedented decline in travel and restaurant activities..."

Step 2: The company experienced a significant decline in gross travel bookings, room nights booked, total revenues, net income, and cash flow from operations compared to the previous year.
Quote: "We expect to continue to see severely reduced new travel and restaurant reservation bookings...which will have a materially adverse impact on our business...we have increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners."

Step 3: The conditions are likely to worsen as the company anticipates a more significant impact on financial performance in the upcoming quarter due to the rising COVID-19 cases and reimposed travel restrictions, particularly in Europe.
Quote: "If these trends continue, we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our financial performance for the three months ending December 31, 2020 more significantly than it impacted the three months ended September 30, 2020..."

Based on the pessimistic sentiment, significant negative impact on financial results, and anticipated worsening conditions, the company has a high risk of bankruptcy in the future.
