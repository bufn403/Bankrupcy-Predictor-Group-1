Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The discussion outlines various measures taken by the company to adapt to the situation and mentions the uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the pandemic on the business.

Step 2:
 - Property Rental Revenues: The decrease in property rental revenues primarily due to lower rental rates and other fee income at stabilized stores related to the COVID-19 pandemic indicates a direct financial impact on the company.

 - General and Administrative Expenses: The increase in expenses related to compensation expense highlights additional costs incurred due to modifications in stock-based awards.

Step 3: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business, leading to reduced rental rates, lower late fee collections, and increased expenses related to property operations, suggests a challenging operating environment. While there were signs of recovery, such as increasing achieved rates and returning to normalcy in some aspects during the third quarter of 2020, uncertainties remain regarding the potential future waves of the pandemic and their impacts on the business.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operating results, occupancy levels, and revenue streams, as well as the ongoing uncertainties related to future developments, indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to adapt to the evolving situation and manage its costs will be vital in determining its financial stability in the coming periods.
