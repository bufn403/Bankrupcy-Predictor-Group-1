High

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion section is pessimistic, indicating high risk of bankruptcy. The discussion repeatedly highlights the severe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results. For example, the text mentions, "The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels," and "The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows." These statements reflect a bleak outlook for the company's immediate future.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion also support the high risk assessment. Total revenues declined significantly, with a $1,064 million decline in the third quarter alone. Additionally, figures such as net income, EBITDAre, and Adjusted FFO per diluted share all saw substantial decreases due to the impact of the pandemic. For instance, net income decreased by $688 million for the quarter, and Adjusted FFO per diluted share decreased by $0.46 for the third quarter. These figures signify a troubling financial situation for the company.

Step 3: The numbers presented clearly indicate a failed quarter with sharp declines in revenues and profitability. The text mentions that the company experienced a severe decrease in group, business, and leisure travel, leading to significant declines in occupancy rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR). The statement that "RevPAR has increased slightly each month during the third quarter," from a very low base, does not provide substantial reassurance as the comparison to the previous year's figures shows a massive decline. The discussion of uncertain recovery and slow economic momentum further suggests that conditions are likely to worsen before improving.

Therefore, based on the pessimistic sentiment, significant financial declines, and uncertain recovery outlook presented in the filing, the company is deemed to have a high risk of bankruptcy.
