Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on their operations and financial situation. For example, the management mentions, "We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties." This uncertainty indicates a more pessimistic tone.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0679 suggests a relatively low level of working capital compared to total assets, indicating potential liquidity concerns.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.8707 shows a high proportion of retained earnings to total assets, indicating stability in the company's earnings and assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.2325 reflects a moderate level of earnings before interest and taxes compared to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.7214 indicates that a significant portion of total assets is tied up in generating revenue.

Step 3: The cautious sentiment in the management discussion combined with the moderate EBIT to Total Assets ratio suggests that the company may be facing challenges due to the pandemic. The relatively low Working Capital to Total Assets ratio further indicates potential liquidity issues, despite the stability shown by the Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio. The Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio, although relatively high, may not fully offset the liquidity concerns.

Step 4: Based on the cautious sentiment, moderate EBIT to Total Assets ratio, low Working Capital to Total Assets ratio, and the overall uncertain impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The high Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides some stability, but the liquidity and operational uncertainties suggest a higher level of risk.
