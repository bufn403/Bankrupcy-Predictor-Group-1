Decision: Low

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business, the management also discusses sequential improvements in business activity and customer engagements as conditions began to normalize. For example, they mention, "We believe the sequential gains in economic activity that we experienced in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 continued through the third quarter of 2020..." and "Customers are beginning to re-engage in discussions involving our growth drivers..." This suggests a forward-looking approach and adaptability to challenges.

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.5287 indicates positive working capital, which means the company has current assets to cover short-term liabilities, a good sign for liquidity.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.7521 suggests that the company has high retained earnings relative to its total assets, indicating financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.3434 represents the earnings generated by the company's total assets, which is a moderate level, indicating operational efficiency.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.6461 shows a relatively high ratio, indicating that the company is generating substantial revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining text analysis and financial ratios, the company appears to have navigated the challenges posed by the pandemic with a focus on cost management and adapting to changing customer demands. The financial ratios indicate a strong financial position with positive working capital, high retained earnings, and efficient earnings generation from assets. The management's discussion of sequential improvements and customer re-engagement further supports the idea of a resilient business model.

Step 4: Considering the positive sentiment in the management's discussion and the solid financial ratios reflecting stability and adaptability, the company is classified as having a low risk of bankruptcy. The company's proactive measures and financial health position them well for future stability and growth.
