Step 1: The management discussion section is acknowledging the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. They mention how the pandemic has affected their business operations and resulted in disruptions, reduced freight volumes, and threats to financial stability, as well as increased bankruptcies among customers.

Quote: "Many of our customers are experiencing disruptions in their revenue and cash flow, including an increased number of bankruptcies, prompting these customers to attempt to renegotiate contractual terms and increasing our accounts receivable collection risk."

Step 2: The company discusses the significant impact on their airfreight services due to the pandemic. They mention a 53% and 49% increase in airfreight services revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. This increase is primarily due to higher sell rates but offset by declines in tonnage, which is a concern.

Quote: "Airfreight services revenues increased 53% and 49% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared with the same periods for 2019, primarily due to 70% and 69% increases in average sell rates offset by 5% and 8% declines in tonnage."

Step 3: Despite the revenue increase in airfreight services, the company faced challenges with higher expenses due to increased buy rates. This impact on expenses may affect profitability in the future. The pandemic-induced disruptions in the supply chain and reduced freight volumes are also noted as negative influences.

Quote: "Airfreight services expenses increased 59% and 56% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, as compared with the same periods for 2019, principally as a result of a 73% and 71% increase in average buy rates. ... The decrease in airfreight tonnage was primarily due to the global pandemic."

Based on the information provided in the management discussion section of the 10-Q filing, the company is facing challenges and uncertainties due to the pandemic, which have impacted their operations, finances, and customer relations. The disruptions, increased expenses, and potential loss of business due to bankruptcies among customers indicate a high risk of bankruptcy.
