We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •server microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers; •CPUs, accelerated processing units (APUs) that integrate CPUs and GPUs, and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers;•discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and•embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, we may also sell or license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio.In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for the three months ended April 1, 2023 compared to the prior year period and an analysis of changes in our financial condition.Net revenue for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was $5.4 billion, a 9% decrease compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net revenue was driven mainly by a 65% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to shipping below consumption to reduce downstream inventory, as well as a 6% decrease in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to a decline in gaming graphics sales. The decrease was partially offset by a 163% increase in Embedded segment revenue driven mainly by the inclusion of a full quarter of Xilinx embedded product sales in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to a partial quarter of Xilinx embedded product sales in the first quarter of 2022, which was measured from February 14, 2022, the date of the Xilinx acquisition (Xilinx Acquisition Date). Gross margin for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was 44% compared to gross margin of 48% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower Client segment performance and higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.Operating loss for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was $145 million compared to operating income of $951 million for the prior year period.  Net loss for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was $139 million compared to net income of $786 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating and net income was primarily due to Client segment performance and higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.During the first quarter of 2023, we launched two new AMD Ryzen™ X3D desktop processors, the Ryzen 9 7900X3D and Ryzen 9 7950X3D processors with 3D V-Cache technology. We introduced the AMD EPYC™ 9004 Series processors, designed to provide technology and features for embedded networking, security/firewall and storage systems in cloud and enterprise computing, as well as industrial edge servers. We also launched the AMD Alveo™ MA35D media accelerator featuring two 5 nanometer, ASIC-based video processing units to power live interactive streaming services at scale. We also expanded our Zynq™ UltraScale™ RFSoC digital front-end portfolio with two additional devices. These RFSoCs will enable the expansion and deployment of 4G/5G radios where lower cost, power and spectrum-efficient radios are required to address increased wireless connectivity. As of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion. During the three months ended April 1, 2023, we generated $486 million of cash from operating activities, and returned $241 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 3 million shares of our common stock under our Board authorized stock repurchase program. As of April 1, 2023, $6.3 billion remains available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes there have been no significant changes for the three months ended April 1, 2023 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact this trend.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:
Data Center net revenue was $1.3 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and remained flat compared to net revenue of $1.3 billion for the prior year period. Higher sales of EPYC processors to cloud customers were offset by lower enterprise server processor sales.  Data Center operating income was $148 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, compared to operating income of $427 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to product mix and higher R&D investment.
Client net revenue of $739 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023 decreased by 65%, compared to net revenue of $2.1 billion for the prior year period, primarily due to lower Client processor sales driven by a 26% decrease in average selling price and a 55% decrease in unit shipments due to shipping below consumption to reduce downstream inventory.Client operating loss was $172 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, compared to operating income of $692 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue.
Gaming net revenue of $1.8 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 decreased by 6%, compared to net revenue of $1.9 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in net revenue was due to lower gaming graphics revenue as a result of soft consumer demand, partially offset by higher semi-custom product sales as demand for gaming console SoCs remained strong.Gaming operating income was $314 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, compared to operating income of $358 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower gaming graphics revenue.
Embedded net revenue of $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 increased by 163%, compared to net revenue of $595 million for the prior year period. The significant increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue for the full fiscal quarter in 2023 as compared to a partial quarter from the Xilinx Acquisition Date in the prior year period. Embedded operating income was $798 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, compared to operating income of $277 million for the prior year period. The significant increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx for the full fiscal quarter in 2023 as compared to a partial quarter from the Xilinx Acquisition Date in the prior year period.
All Other operating loss of $1.2 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 primarily consisted of $823 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $309 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $111 million of acquisition-related costs. All Other operating loss of $803 million for the prior year period primarily consisted of $479 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $199 million of stock-based compensation expense, $208 million of acquisition-related costs, and $83 million of licensing gain.Acquisition-related costs primarily include transaction costs, depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation charges, and contract termination costs.
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 68% and 69% for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.
The following is a summary of certain condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated:
Gross margin was 44% and 48% for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower Client segment performance and higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 increased by $351 million, or 33%, compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $585 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023 decreased by $12 million, or 2%, compared to $597 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in go-to-market activities.
For the three months ended April 1, 2023, cost of sales and operating expense included $305 million and $518 million, respectively, of amortization expense from acquired intangible assets. For the three months ended March 26, 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $186 million and $293 million, respectively, of amortization expense from acquired intangible assets.
During the three months ended April 1, 2023, we recognized $10 million of licensing gain from royalty income associated with Licensed IP. During the three months ended March 26, 2022, we recognized $83 million of licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income associated with Licensed IP.
Interest expense for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was $25 million compared to $13 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024, the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together, the Assumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes that were issued in June 2022.
Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was $43 million, primarily due to $47 million of interest income driven by rising interest rates. Other expense, net for the prior year period was $42 million, primarily due to a decrease of $44 million in the fair value of equity investments.
We recorded an income tax provision of $13 million and $113 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of (10.3)% and 12.6%, respectively. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 was primarily due to the geographic mix of income taxed in lower tax rate jurisdictions, research credits and the beneficial rate impact from the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax benefit.The lower tax provision for the three months ended April 1, 2023 was primarily due to the year-to-date pre-tax loss, which was more than offset by the impact of discrete interest and penalties on liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
As of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion. The percentage of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held domestically as of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were 77% and 73%, respectively.Our operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended April 1, 2023 compared to the prior year period are as described below:
We have a Revolving Credit Agreement that provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion.We also have a commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of April 1, 2023, our principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion, which primarily included $1.5 billion of the Assumed Xilinx Notes and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes, compared to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. As of April 1, 2023, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $6.8 billion, of which $4.4 billion are for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Agreement and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $486 million in the three months ended April 1, 2023, primarily due to our net loss of $139 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.0 billion and net cash outflows of $387 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary driver of the change in operating assets and liabilities was a $464 million increase in inventory primarily in anticipation of the ramp of Data Center and Client products in advanced process nodes. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion in the three months ended March 26, 2022, primarily due to our net income of $786 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $631 million and net cash outflows of $422 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $672 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and a $260 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets driven primarily by prepayments under long-term supply agreements, partially offset by a $412 million increase in accrued and other liabilities driven primarily by higher customer-related accruals.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the three months ended April 1, 2023 which primarily consisted of cash used in the purchases of short-term investments of $1.7 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $158 million, partially offset by $618 million of proceeds from the maturity and sale of short-term investments.Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 26, 2022 which primarily consisted of $2.4 billion of cash received from Xilinx and $963 million of proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $100 million and purchases of property and equipment of $71 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $259 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $241 million and repurchases for tax withholding on employee equity plans of $21 million, partially offset by a cash inflow of $3 million from issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans.Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 26, 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.9 billion and repurchases for tax withholding on employee equity plans of $35 million, partially offset by a cash inflow of $2 million from issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans.
