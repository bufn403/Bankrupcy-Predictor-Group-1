Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion appears optimistic. The company highlights actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as implementing safety measures, strengthening liquidity, and resuming share repurchase programs based on improved business conditions.

Step 2: Relevant numbers provided indicate a positive trend in sales growth. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2020, increased by 20%, and comparable store sales also showed positive figures for both periods. The increase in gross profit dollars is attributed to new stores, sales growth, and acquisitions.

Step 3: The company faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in negative transaction counts initially. However, government stimulus and market reopening led to strong demand, reflected in the improved sales figures. The company's actions to adapt to the crisis and the subsequent recovery indicate resilience.

Given the improvements in sales, gross profit, and operational income, as well as the company's proactive responses to challenges, the overall risk of bankruptcy is assessed as medium. The company's ability to navigate through the crisis and drive sales growth suggests a moderate risk level.
