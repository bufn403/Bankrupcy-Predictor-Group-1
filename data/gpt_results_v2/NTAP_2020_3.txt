Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They mention challenges due to COVID-19 but also highlight opportunities for growth.

Step 2: The financial metrics show a slight increase in net revenues, primarily driven by software and hardware maintenance revenues, but a decrease in product revenues. Gross profit margins decreased due to an increase in materials costs and a decline in selling prices.

Step 3: The company declared a restructuring plan to optimize their business, with associated costs of $37 million in severance-related expenses. They also incurred acquisition-related expenses and experienced a gain on the sale of assets, offset by interest expenses.

Based on the above analysis, the company exhibits medium risk of bankruptcy. While they face challenges due to COVID-19 and have incurred significant restructuring costs, their revenue is stable and they are actively optimizing their business and pursuing growth opportunities.
