Decision: Medium

Step 1: The management discussion text mentions challenges faced due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such as reduced sales, operational disruptions, and uncertainties impacting the business. While there is optimism about long-term prospects, the current situation presents risks. Overall, the tone is cautious and acknowledges the adverse effects of the pandemic, indicating some level of concern.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) ratio of 0.063 suggests a lower ability to cover short-term obligations with assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) ratio of 0.589 indicates a substantial portion of assets funded by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) ratio of 0.044 shows a relatively low earnings generated from total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) ratio of 0.308 implies that revenue generated from assets is moderate.

Step 3: The financial ratios indicate a mixed picture. While the company has a decent amount of retained earnings compared to total assets, the low EBIT to Total Assets ratio and Working Capital to Total Assets ratio suggest some strain on profitability and short-term liquidity. The challenges mentioned in the management discussion, especially related to the COVID-19 impact, further emphasize the uncertainties and risks the company is facing in the current period.

Step 4: Considering the cautious tone in the management discussion, along with the mix of financial ratios indicating both strengths and weaknesses, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The current challenges, coupled with the financial indicators, suggest a level of uncertainty in the company's financial stability.
