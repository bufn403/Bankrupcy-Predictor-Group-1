Step 1: The management's discussion of financial performance is neutral, focusing on summarizing significant changes in financial performance and volatility. It does not explicitly express optimism or pessimism.

Step 2:
- The company experienced changes in total contract volume and revenue, with average rate per contract being influenced by various factors such as rate structure and trading venue.
- Interest rate contract volumes decreased due to low interest rate volatility.
- Equity index contract volumes increased, mainly due to significant market volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Overall commodity contract volume increased in some areas like soybean and wheat but decreased in corn.
- Metal products volumes increased, potentially due to investors using metals as safe-haven investments.

Step 3: The company faced changes in contract volumes across different product categories, influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility, government actions responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic uncertainty. The company adapted to the changing environment by closing and partially reopening the trading floor. Despite decreases in certain volumes, the company made strategic decisions to integrate acquired businesses, reduce travel expenses, and adjust marketing efforts.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial performance is impacted by various market factors, and while it has shown adaptability and cost-saving measures, the changes in contract volumes and revenues suggest some level of vulnerability to external economic conditions. The decreases in operating expenses are positive signs, but the overall market volatility and uncertainties from the global landscape could pose challenges in the future, warranting a medium risk assessment.
