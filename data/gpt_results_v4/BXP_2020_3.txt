Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion appears to be cautiously optimistic. While the company acknowledges the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global macroeconomic conditions and their business, they outline strategic priorities to navigate through the crisis. There is an emphasis on maintaining tenant satisfaction, implementing safety measures, and reiterating confidence in their ability to manage business successfully in uncertain market conditions.

Step 2:
- Rent Collections: The company reports strong rent collections from office tenants at 99%, but lower collections at 62% from retail tenants during the third quarter of 2020. The significant reliance on current rent payments, especially in the retail sector, can pose a risk if tenants continue to defer payments.
- Occupancy Rates: The overall occupancy of the company's in-service office and retail properties was at 91.1% as of September 30, 2020, showcasing operational stability. However, there was a marginal decrease in occupancy compared to the previous quarter.
- Development Projects: The company has approximately 4.3 million square feet of active developments and redevelopments in the pipeline, with 80% pre-leased. This level of ongoing development indicates a commitment to growth but also poses risks associated with construction delays and market demand uncertainties.

Step 3: While the company has been able to maintain a relatively high occupancy rate and secure lease agreements during the challenging COVID-19 period, the lower rent collections from retail tenants, uncertainty in future leasing decisions by tenants, and the impact on revenue streams, especially from transient parking and hotel properties, pose potential risks to the financial health of the company. The strategic initiatives to maintain tenant satisfaction and focus on long-term leasing may provide a buffer but do not eliminate the potential challenges.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The current environment of deferred rent payments, challenges in the hotel and retail sectors, and uncertainties in the leasing market, combined with the company's dependence on current rent collections, slightly elevate the risk of financial strain. While the strategic emphasis on tenant relationships and ongoing developments may help mitigate some risks, the uncertainties surrounding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact on business operations warrant a cautious outlook.
