Decision: High

Step 1: The management discussion text indicates several challenges faced by the company due to COVID-19, such as decreased operating revenues, increased credit loss expense, and direct costs related to the pandemic. This paints a pessimistic picture of the company's current financial situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value indicates potential liquidity issues, where current liabilities exceed current assets, posing a risk to the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A relatively low value suggests that a significant portion of assets is funded by external sources rather than internally generated profits, indicating financial leverage.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): A moderate value shows the company's ability to generate earnings relative to its total assets, but this may not be sufficient to cover all financial obligations.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A low value implies that the company's assets are not generating significant revenues, raising concerns about the efficiency of asset utilization.

Step 3: The negative working capital, low retained earnings, and challenges highlighted in the management discussion suggest financial strain. The financial ratios indicate a need for improved profitability and asset management. The company's reliance on external financing and the impact of COVID-19 on its operations are red flags for financial health.

Step 4: High. The combination of negative working capital, low profitability ratios, and the pessimistic tone in the management discussion indicate a high risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial position appears to be under pressure, requiring strategic adjustments to improve its stability in the future.
