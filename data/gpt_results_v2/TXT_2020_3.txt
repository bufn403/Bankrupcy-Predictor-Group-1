They mention uncertainty in the economic outlook and state that the ultimate extent of the effects of the pandemic is uncertain.

Step 2: They provide details on the decrease in revenues, operating expenses, and segment profits in various segments of the company. For example, they discuss the decrease in revenues in the Textron Aviation segment due to lower demand related to the pandemic.
