Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: 
The overall sentiment of the management discussion appears to be optimistic as it highlights the company's strengths, such as providing a wide range of financial services, discussing key performance indicators, and addressing the impact of external factors like Covid-19. Despite the lack of specific headlines, the tone from the Management Discussion Text is positive and forward-looking.

Step 2:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets ratio (-0.122) typically indicates a potential financial strain as current liabilities exceed current assets, which could impact the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A positive retained earnings to total assets ratio (0.378) suggests that the company has been profitable and has retained earnings to reinvest in the business, indicating financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): EBIT to total assets ratio (0.114) shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets, which is a positive sign for financial health.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): High total revenue to total assets ratio (0.736) indicates that the company is efficient in generating revenue from its assets.

Step 3:
Considering the financial ratios, while the company has a positive Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio and a high Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio, the negative Working Capital to Total Assets ratio raises concerns about short-term liquidity. The EBIT to Total Assets ratio indicates profitability but may not be sufficient to overcome working capital challenges. The overall financial health seems stable with room for improvement in liquidity management.

Step 4:
Based on the analysis of the sentiment in the Management Discussion Text, the financial ratios, and a balanced view of the company's financial health, the company is classified as having a Medium risk of bankruptcy. The positive aspects such as profitability and revenue generation are counterbalanced by the potential liquidity challenges indicated by the negative working capital ratio. The company may need to focus on strengthening its short-term financial position to reduce the risk further.
