Step 1: The management's discussion in Grainger's 10-Q filing reflects a mixed sentiment. While there is a strategic focus on expanding leadership in the MRO space and remaining operational during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are clear impacts outlined due to the pandemic, including severe declines in high-touch businesses in international markets. The company's efforts to serve customers and communities indicate a cautious approach to managing the situation.

Step 2:
- Net Sales: The company experienced fluctuations in net sales, with increases attributed to COVID-19 pandemic-related product sales, but also declines in non-pandemic product sales and disruptions in certain markets.
- Gross Profit Margin: There was a significant decrease in gross profit margin due to lower margins from COVID-19 pandemic-related products, impacting profitability.
- SG&A Expenses: While the company reduced SG&A expenses in certain areas, there were incremental costs related to safety protocols, employee support during the pandemic, and ensuring operational continuity.

Step 3: The operational facilities and infrastructure remained intact with limited disruptions, and the company managed to absorb the pandemic impact with minimal workforce reductions. They focused on liquidity by repaying revolver drawdown and maintaining available liquidity. However, the adverse impact on gross profit margins from lower-margin COVID-19 related product sales indicates ongoing challenges.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite efforts to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, the substantial decline in gross profit margin, the significant year-over-year decrease in operating earnings, and the continued uncertainty around the pandemic's impact on future periods suggest there is a medium level of risk for bankruptcy. The company needs to address the margin challenges and continue adapting its operations to navigate the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions.
