Decision: Low risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge challenges posed by COVID-19 and the derecho windstorm but emphasize their ability to continue operations and focus on providing services while taking necessary precautions.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures show that Alliant Energy has not experienced significant impacts on their overall business operations, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. They have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of sales declines, maintain liquidity, and manage operational changes effectively.

Step 3: The numbers and figures indicate that sales impacts due to COVID-19 have been partially offset by higher electric residential sales. They expect to maintain compliance with financial covenants and have adequate liquidity. Additionally, planned projects and acquisitions are progressing as planned, with a focus on cleaner energy strategies and operational improvements.

Final decision: Alliant Energy shows a low risk of bankruptcy in the future based on the management's discussion. They have effectively managed challenges, maintained financial stability, and are strategically investing in renewable energy projects for future growth.
