Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is somewhat mixed. While the company mentions mitigating potential risks related to COVID-19 and taking steps to ensure liquidity, there are also mentions of financial impacts from the pandemic, such as increased uncollectible accounts expense and decreased revenues.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.025 indicates a negative working capital, which can be a concerning sign as it implies that current liabilities exceed current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.055 shows a relatively low proportion of retained earnings to total assets, which could indicate lower financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.055 suggests a moderate return on assets, but further analysis is needed to assess if it's enough to cover the company's obligations.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.140 reflects a decent ratio of total revenue to total assets, which could indicate some level of efficiency in asset utilization.

Step 3: The negative working capital (X1) and relatively low retained earnings to total assets (X2) indicate potential financial strain, while the moderate return on assets (X3) and decent total revenue to total assets (X5) provide some level of stability. The mentions of financial impacts from the pandemic and the need to consider alternative sources of funding suggest a challenging quarter.

Step 4: Based on the mixed sentiment in the management's discussion and the financial ratios pointing towards some financial strain, along with the challenges mentioned related to the pandemic, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite some positive indicators, the overall picture indicates a level of financial fragility that warrants caution.
