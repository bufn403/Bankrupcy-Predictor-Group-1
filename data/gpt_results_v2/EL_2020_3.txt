Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They mention challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic but also highlight areas of growth and success in certain product categories and regions. For example, they state, "Net sales growth of our products online has remained strong in every region...". This shows some resilience in their online sales despite the challenges.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided indicate a mix of increases and decreases in net sales across different product categories and regions. The management highlights increases in skin care and fragrance net sales, driven by successful launches and events. However, makeup net sales decreased mainly due to the consumer preference shift towards skin care products during the pandemic.

Step 3: Despite challenges in brick-and-mortar retail and decline in certain areas like makeup sales, there are signs of growth in skin care and fragrance categories, specifically in regions like Asia/Pacific. The company's focus on online sales and successful products like Est√©e Lauder and La Mer further support a potential improvement in conditions.

Step 4: Considering the cautiously optimistic sentiment, the mix of increases and decreases in net sales, and the resilience shown in certain product categories and regions, the company is determined to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. While the challenges from the pandemic and economic uncertainties are acknowledged, the company's strategies and efforts towards cost control and growth areas provide a level of stability that doesn't indicate immediate high risk.
