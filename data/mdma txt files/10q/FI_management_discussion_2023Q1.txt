We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the necessary business assets to execute our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. The results of operations for the following acquired and divested businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition and through the respective dates of disposition.
On December 29, 2022, we acquired OrangeData S.A. (“Yacaré”), an Argentina-based payment service provider that enables customers to transact at merchant locations using QR codes. Yacaré is included within the Acceptance segment and enhances our instant payment transaction capabilities. On December 20, 2022, we acquired Merchant One, Inc. (“Merchant One”), an independent sales organization (“ISO”) focused on acquiring merchants in the restaurant, retail and e-commerce industries using an innovative mix of direct and digital marketing strategies. Merchant One is included within the Acceptance segment and enhances our merchant distribution and sales force channels. On September 1, 2022, we acquired NexTable, Inc. (“NexTable”), a provider of cloud-based reservation and table management solutions for restaurants. NexTable is included within the Acceptance segment and expands our end-to-end restaurant solutions.

(“Finxact”), a developer of cloud-native banking solutions powering digital transformation throughout the financial services sector. Finxact is included within the Fintech segment and advances our digital banking strategy, expanding our account processing, digital, and payments solutions. We acquired these businesses in 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994 million, net of $28 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $6 million.
On October 17, 2022, we sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our Systems Integration Services (“SIS”) operations, which provides information technology engineering services in the United States (“U.S.”) and India, to a single buyer. Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and SIS were reported primarily within our Fintech segment. On September 30, 2022, we sold our Korea operations, which were reported in our Acceptance segment. We sold these operations in 2022 for total consideration of $99 million and recognized an aggregate net pre-tax loss on the sales of $83 million. During the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $3 million associated with final working capital adjustments related to the disposition of Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. These divestitures were the result of a strategic review of our business portfolio.In 2021, we mutually agreed with a minority partner to terminate one of our merchant alliance joint ventures effective March 2022. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for $175 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $147 million in the first quarter of 2022.
The global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.
The rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to accept payments and help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern systems to streamline the complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants.Additionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. Such providers are typically referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us.We believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of financial and non-financial institutions of all sizes, gives us a solid foundation for growth.
Financial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions and other financial technology providers continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions and other financial technology providers will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. The number of financial institutions in the U.S. has declined at a relatively steady rate, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.
Global macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, regulations restricting trade or impacting our ability to offer products or services, and the continuing impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, we have observed increased shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices. We continue to monitor and actively manage our business in response to these unpredictable geopolitical and market conditions, as they may adversely impact our operations and financial results.In addition, our operating results in certain foreign countries in which we operate may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, British pound sterling and Argentine peso. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies in countries in which we operate would negatively impact our revenue and earnings. While the majority of our revenue is earned domestically, we continually monitor the foreign exchange rate environment in an effort to help mitigate these risks.
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified our critical accounting policies and estimates. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, we estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions and may record purchase accounting adjustments during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgement and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The unaudited financial results presented below have been affected by acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency fluctuations.
(1)Percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue, expense or income amount divided by total revenue, except for cost of processing and services and cost of product amounts, which are divided by the related component of revenue.
(1)Represents the basis point growth or decline in operating margin.Operating margin percentages are calculated using actual, unrounded amounts.
Total revenue increased $409 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increase was driven by product sales, as well as higher processing revenue across all of our business segments, partially offset by a 3% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Revenue in our Acceptance segment increased $194 million, or 12%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increase was driven by higher merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, including on our Clover and Carat operating systems, an increase in processing volumes in our international regions and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. This growth was partially offset by a 5% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Revenue in our Fintech segment increased $14 million, or 2%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increase was driven by higher revenue in our core account processing businesses.Revenue in our Payments segment increased $167 million, or 11%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. In the first quarter of 2023, our debit processing business contributed 4% to Payments revenue growth primarily driven by an increase in transactions and new client growth; our Output Solutions business contributed 2%, primarily driven by increased volumes and new client growth; and our credit processing business contributed 1%, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts due to new business onboarding. Favorable pricing and increased volumes also drove revenue growth across our remaining Payments segment businesses.Revenue at Corporate and Other increased $34 million, or 14%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased postage revenue.
Total expenses increased $321 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 10 basis points to 79.5% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 38.3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 42.7% in the first quarter of 2022. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to strong operating leverage accompanying scalable revenue growth and expense management initiatives across our businesses, along with approximately 50 basis points from decreased severance costs.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 68.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 69.3% in the first quarter of 2022. The cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of revenue mix, including increased hardware revenue.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 35.3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the first quarter of 2023 was due to a reduction of approximately 110 basis points in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily offset by an increase of approximately 70 basis points in acquisition and integration related expenses.The net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in the first quarter of 2022 included a $147 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures.
Total operating income increased $88 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, and total operating margin was flat at 20.5%. Total operating income and total operating margin benefited from revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023, along with a reduction in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. Total operating margin in the first quarter of 2022 was favorably impacted by a $147 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures.Operating income in our Acceptance segment increased $92 million, or 20%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Operating margin increased 210 basis points to 30.5% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Operating income and operating margin growth in our Acceptance segment was primarily due to operating leverage and expense management initiatives.Operating income in our Fintech segment increased $5 million, or 2%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 and operating margin was flat at 35.4%. Fintech segment operating margin was impacted by our continued investments in Finxact with slight growth in license and termination fee revenue.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $93 million, or 15%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 43.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Payments segment operating income and margin growth in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to scalable revenue growth from our debit and credit processing businesses and expense management initiatives.The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $102 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The operating loss in the first quarter of 2022 included a $147 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by a reduction of $48 million in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in the first quarter of 2023.
Interest expense, net increased $34 million, or 20%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher interest rates, as well as higher outstanding borrowings including our public offering and issuance of $1.8 billion of senior notes in March 2023.
Other expense increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Other (expense) income includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. Net foreign currency transaction losses were $24 million and $9 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and (loss) income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 17.4% and 14.5% in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 includes discrete tax benefits from subsidiary restructurings and equity compensation related tax benefits.
Our share of net (loss) income from unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as (loss) income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. (Loss) income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $(12) million and $106 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the first quarter of 2022 included pre-tax net gains totaling $91 million related to certain equity investment transactions.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners’ share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $13 million in both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022.
Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $0.89 and $1.02 in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in the first quarter of 2022 included a $147 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures and net gains of $91 million related to certain equity investment transactions.
Our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion (net of outstanding borrowings and $4.3 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in 2023 and letters of credit) at March 31, 2023.The following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, and capital expenditure amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:
Our operating cash flow was $1.13 billion in the first three months of 2023, an increase of 39% compared with $815 million in the first three months of 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, along with favorable fluctuations in working capital, including higher collections of accounts receivable.We maintain investments in various unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for as equity method investments. Total distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, including those classified as cash flows from investing activities, were $45 million and $80 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 7% and 8% of our total revenue for the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We repurchased $1.5 billion and $500 million of our common stock during the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. On February 22, 2023, our board of directors approved an additional repurchase authorization for up to 75.0 million shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately 78.7 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.
We acquired Yacaré and Merchant One in December 2022, NexTable in September 2022 and City POS in June 2022. Additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in Finxact in April 2022, in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest. City POS and the remaining ownership interest in Finxact were acquired during the second quarter of 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of $671 million, net of $27 million of acquired cash, and NexTable during the third quarter of 2022 for $15 million, including earn-out provisions with a fair value of approximately $6 million. Merchant One and Yacaré were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $308 million, net of $1 million of acquired cash.We funded these acquisitions in 2022 by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.
We sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A and our SIS operations in October 2022 for net cash proceeds of $34 million and our Korea operations in September 2022 for net cash proceeds of $43 million, along with a minority noncontrolling equity interest in the buyer of the Korea operations. Effective March 2022, we mutually agreed to terminate a merchant alliance joint venture with a minority partner. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for cash proceeds of $175 million. The net proceeds from these dispositions were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock.
In March 2023, we completed the public offering and issuance of $1.8 billion of senior notes, comprised of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% senior notes due in March 2028 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.60% senior notes due in March 2033. We used the net proceeds from these senior notes offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of  U.S. dollar commercial paper notes.At March 31, 2023, our debt consisted primarily of $18.6 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and $2.7 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loan is paid monthly. Outstanding borrowings under our 0.375% Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in October 2023, and U.S dollar and Euro commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as further discussed below.
Our variable rate debt consisted of the following at March 31, 2023:
We maintain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund anticipated settlement activity associated with our operations in Latin America. We maintain U.S. dollar and Euro unsecured commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. Outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance.We maintain a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments available for $6.0 billion of total capacity. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a base rate in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. We are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time.We maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR or a base rate, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time.
The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date.The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions.The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.5 times our EBITDA during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain EBITDA of at least 3.0 times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.During the first three months of 2023, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.
We maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&C, LLC (“Sagent”) and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the “Lending Joint Ventures”). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain, as amended in April 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $437 million in senior unsecured debt at March 31, 2023 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were $28 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at March 31, 2023. We have guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. We maintained a liability of $38 million at March 31, 2023 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. In addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $21 million at March 31, 2023, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so.
Investments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. The table below details our cash and cash equivalents held at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:
