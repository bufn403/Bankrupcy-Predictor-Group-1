Step 1: The management's discussion conveys the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. Although the company has taken steps to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, such as cost-cutting measures, adjustments in workforce, and real estate footprint reductions, the continued negative impacts on the company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial position highlight the uncertain and challenging environment.

Step 2: 
- Organic Net Revenue: The organic net revenue decreased significantly in the third quarter and the nine months of 2020, reflecting a decline in business demand due to the pandemic's economic impacts.
- Operating Expenses Management: The company took restructuring actions to lower operating expenses, including reductions in workforce, office space, and other direct expenses, to align with the reduced revenue.
- Debt Issuance and Credit Facility Entry: The company issued senior unsecured notes and entered into a new credit facility in response to the heightened uncertainty in the business environment, indicating the need for additional financial resources during the pandemic.

Step 3: The discussion indicates that the company faced challenges due to the pandemic-induced economic downturn, leading to a decline in organic net revenue and necessitating significant restructuring actions. The company's focus on cost-cutting measures and strengthening its financial position through debt issuance and credit facility entry reflects proactive steps to address the adverse effects of the pandemic. However, the ongoing negative impacts on financial performance suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy, as the company continues to navigate the uncertain economic conditions.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite the company's efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic through cost-cutting measures and strategic financial decisions, the persisting challenges in revenue generation and financial performance indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the economic impacts of COVID-19.
