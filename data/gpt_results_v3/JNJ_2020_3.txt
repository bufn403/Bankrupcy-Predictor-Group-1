Final Decision: Medium Risk

- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.043 - This ratio indicates a relatively low level of working capital in relation to total assets, which may imply potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.918 - A high ratio like this generally signifies that the company has been profitable and has accumulated a substantial amount in retained earnings, which is a positive indicator of financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.094 - This ratio suggests that the company's earnings before interest and taxes in relation to total assets are moderate, indicating decent profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.508 - This ratio indicates that the company generates revenue relative to its total assets, showing a decent level of asset utilization.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the text analysis and the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges, particularly in the Medical Devices segment due to the negative impact of COVID-19. While there are positive growth aspects in segments like Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical, the overall mixed sentiment and the low working capital to total assets ratio suggest medium financial risk.

Step 4: The company is assessed as having a Medium Risk of bankruptcy. The financial stability indicators are mixed, with some positive aspects such as high retained earnings, but also concerning aspects such as low working capital and challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 on certain segments. Overall, the company's financial health appears to be in a somewhat precarious position, warranting caution.
