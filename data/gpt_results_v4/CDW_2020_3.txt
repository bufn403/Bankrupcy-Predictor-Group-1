Step 1: The management's discussion is cautious and detailed, focusing on multiple factors that could impact the company's performance, such as general economic conditions, the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology trends, and Brexit. The discussion also highlights the company's efforts to manage risks associated with the pandemic, enhance liquidity, monitor cash collections, and adjust their cost structure.

Step 2: The financial indicators presented in the discussion show a decline in net sales, particularly across various segments, driven by factors like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer demand. Despite measures taken to manage costs, such as a workforce reduction program, operating income decreased due to higher expenses associated with the pandemic. Additionally, there was an increase in selling and administrative expenses, impacting operating margin.

Step 3: The significant decrease in net sales, particularly in the Corporate and Small Business segments, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various customer categories like Healthcare, Education, and Government, suggests a challenging operational environment. The additional costs related to the pandemic and Brexit uncertainties further add to the risks facing the company.

Step 4: The substantial decline in net sales, coupled with increased expenses, lower operating income, and the cautious approach in the management's discussion regarding economic conditions and the pandemic, indicate a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. The detailed assessment of challenges and uncertainties in the business environment suggests that the company may face financial difficulties in the future.
