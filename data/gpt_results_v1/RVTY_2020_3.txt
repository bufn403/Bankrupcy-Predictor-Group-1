Step 2: In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the company experienced a significant increase in revenue compared to the previous year, driven by the Diagnostics segment's revenue increase of 93%. This growth was attributed to increased demand for COVID-19-related products. However, there was a slight decrease in revenue from the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment.

The company's gross margins and operating margins improved significantly, showcasing cost management efforts. They also mention investments in new product development and growth initiatives, which could impact future profitability.

Based on the above analysis, the company's revenue growth driven by the Diagnostics segment's performance is a positive sign. However, the challenges faced by the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment and the mention of restructuring actions indicate potential risks. The cautiously optimistic sentiment, coupled with the impact of the pandemic on certain market segments, leads to the assessment of a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to navigate through the pandemic-related challenges and successfully implement growth initiatives will be crucial in determining its future financial health.
