Step 1: The management's discussion overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge the impact of COVID-19 but emphasize the resilience of the business model and the belief in positive momentum ahead.
Quote: "Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Our 2021 fiscal year includes 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, while fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks. ... we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic."

Step 2: The financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 show a decline in net revenues, especially in the Americas and International segments, primarily due to reduced customer traffic and temporary store closures caused by COVID-19. They also mention an increase in certain expenses.
Quote: "Consolidated net revenues declined 5%... Americas total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased $308 million, or 6%... International total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $83 million, or 5%."

Step 3: The company has closed stores in the Americas and is expected to close additional stores in the U.S. and Canada over the next 9 to 12 months. This restructuring effort suggests financial challenges persist.
Quote: "During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed approximately 170 stores in the U.S. and Canada, and we expect to close an additional 500 stores in those markets primarily over the next 9 to 12 months to complete our restructuring efforts."

Step 4: Considering the revenue decline, ongoing store closures, and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy. While they express confidence in their ability to recover, the current financial challenges and restructuring efforts indicate a level of instability.
Therefore, the overall assessment based on the information provided suggests a medium risk of bankruptcy for the company.
