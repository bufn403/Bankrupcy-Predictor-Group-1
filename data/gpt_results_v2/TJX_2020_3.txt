Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious given the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The management highlights the uncertainties and challenges faced, such as temporary store closures and changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic.

Step 2: The company experienced a 28% decrease in net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the same period last year, resulting in net operating losses. Despite generating positive operating cash flows in the third quarter and having $10.6 billion of cash, the company incurred additional costs associated with implementing health and safety protocols, which impacted their expenses.

Step 3: The company's financial performance for the quarter ended October 31, 2020, saw a 3% decrease in net sales compared to the previous year. While the company was able to increase its cash position and borrowing capacity, the impact of the temporary store closures and reduced sales volume negatively affected the expense ratio and overall financial performance.

Final Decision: The company has medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The significant decrease in net sales, ongoing challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on expenses and financial performance highlight the risks faced by the company. Despite having cash reserves and borrowing capacity, the uncertainties in the global economy and unpredictable nature of the pandemic suggest a medium level of risk for potential bankruptcy.
