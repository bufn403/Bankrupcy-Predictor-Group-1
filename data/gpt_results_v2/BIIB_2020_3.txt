Low

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious due to intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry and uncertain reimbursement for new products. A quote supporting this sentiment is, "Drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis." This indicates a pessimistic outlook on the future business environment.

Step 2: The discussion mentions the increasing competition from generic versions, prodrugs, and biosimilars of existing products, which can significantly reduce product prices and sales volume. This is highlighted in the statement, "Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products." This indicates potential challenges in maintaining revenue growth.

Step 3: The uncertainty around reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products and the impact of competition on pricing actions pose risks to the company's sales and operations. The mention of risks related to international business, including the impact of public health epidemics like COVID-19, adds further complexity to the future outlook. This uncertainty may lead to a failed quarter and hinder the company's ability to generate sufficient revenue.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, the challenges posed by increasing competition, pricing pressure, uncertain reimbursement, and international business risks, the company faces a medium risk of bankruptcy. The lack of clarity in pricing and reimbursement, coupled with intense competition and external risks, could adversely impact the company's financial stability in the future.
