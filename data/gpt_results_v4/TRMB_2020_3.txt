Step 1: The management's discussion contains information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of protocols to safeguard employees and ensure business continuity, and a decline in overall revenue due to reduced hardware and professional service sales. While recurring revenue increased, the decline in other revenue streams signifies challenges faced by the company.

Step 2: 
- Product Revenue: There is a decline in product revenue over the quarters, particularly in the Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Transportation segments.
- Operating Income: Despite certain segments showing improvement in operating income, the overall decrease in revenue and profitability in the Transportation segment, along with reduced professional services revenue, indicates underlying financial struggles.
  
Step 3: The discussion indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a noticeable impact on the company's revenue streams. While recurring revenue increased, the decline in other revenue sources, such as hardware sales and professional services, is a cause for concern. The overall decline in product revenue and the reduction in overall revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 showcase financial challenges the company is facing.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The decline in product revenue, reduced professional services revenue, and challenges in the Transportation segment, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance, suggest a high risk of bankruptcy. The overall decrease in revenue and the financial struggles highlighted in the management's discussion indicate a potentially unstable financial position.
