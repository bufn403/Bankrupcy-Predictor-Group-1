This demonstrates a cautious and guarded tone about the future outlook.

Step 2: They provide specific factors that pose risks to their operations, such as changes in market demand, increasing costs, changes in relationships with carriers, operational risks outside the United States, fuel price changes, and cybersecurity risks.

Step 3: The discussion does not provide strong indications of a successful quarter nor does it suggest improvements in the near future. The emphasis on risks and uncertainties implies a challenging environment ahead.

This quote supports this point, "risks associated with the produce industry, including food safety and contamination issues; fuel price increases or decreases, or fuel shortages..."
