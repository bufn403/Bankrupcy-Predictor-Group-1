Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be a mix of positive indicators and cautionary notes regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other operational factors.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value indicates potential liquidity issues and a strain on the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A negative value suggests that the company's retained earnings are not sufficient to cover its total assets, which may signal financial instability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): A positive value suggests the company is generating earnings from its assets, but the ratio is relatively low, indicating room for improvement in asset utilization.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A moderate value suggests the company is generating revenue from its assets, but it could be further optimized for better financial health.

Step 3: The company's financial ratios indicate a mixed picture with liquidity and profitability concerns, coupled with revenue generation from assets. The text highlights both positive developments (such as completed projects and revenue from renewables) and challenges (such as impairments on certain assets and pandemic-related impacts on demand).

Step 4: Considering the combination of the cautionary sentiment in the management discussion, the concerning financial ratios, and the overall mixed performance described in the text, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The negative working capital and retained earnings to total assets ratios suggest financial strain, despite some positive initiatives in sustainable growth and revenue generation. Further improvements in operational efficiency and financial stability are necessary to mitigate the risk of potential bankruptcy.
