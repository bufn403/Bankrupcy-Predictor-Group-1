Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be a mix of optimism and caution. While the company mentions challenges in the macroeconomic environment and revenue declines, they also highlight their focus on supporting employees, customers, and communities during the pandemic. However, the uncertainty in markets is acknowledged. 

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The calculated value of 0.118 indicates that the company has positive working capital relative to its total assets, which is generally a good sign for financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.016, this ratio suggests that a relatively small portion of total assets is represented by retained earnings, potentially indicating lower profitability or reinvestment.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio of 0.154 indicates the company's ability to generate earnings from its total assets, which is a positive sign.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A high value of 0.560 implies that the company is generating significant revenue compared to its total assets, which can be a positive indicator of efficiency.

Step 3: The combination of financial ratios and text analysis suggests a moderately stable financial health. The positive aspects include positive working capital, earnings generation from assets, and significant revenue generation. However, lower retained earnings may indicate limited profitability or reinvestment opportunities. The cautious sentiment in the text regarding challenges in the global environment adds an element of risk.

Step 4: Overall, the company exhibits a mix of positive and cautionary signals. While the financial ratios demonstrate some strength, the acknowledgment of challenging market conditions and revenue declines indicate potential risks. Therefore, considering the overall analysis, the company is classified as having a Medium risk of bankruptcy.
