Final Decision: High

Step 1: The sentiment in the management discussion text leans towards pessimism and uncertainty due to the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations. For example, the text mentions, "The disruptions to our operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic...have had, and continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value for this ratio indicates that the company's current assets may not be sufficient to cover its current liabilities, which can be a sign of financial distress.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Another negative value, suggesting that the company's retained earnings are low compared to its total assets, which may indicate a lack of profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): This ratio is positive but not significantly high, indicating that the company's earnings are moderate in relation to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A value of 0.395 indicates that the company generates revenue but may not be efficiently utilizing its assets to generate higher revenue.

Step 3: The combination of negative working capital, low retained earnings, and moderate earnings in relation to total assets, along with the challenges mentioned in the management discussion regarding COVID-19 impact, suggest a financially challenging quarter for the company. The uncertainty surrounding the resumption of operations, the impairment charges recorded, and the need for extensive health and safety measures also contribute to the high-risk assessment.

Step 4: The overall sentiment, the negative financial ratios, and the challenges faced by the company indicate a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The impact of COVID-19 on operations, impairment charges, and uncertainties regarding resuming operations all point towards financial distress.
