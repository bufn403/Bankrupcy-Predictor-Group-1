Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion expresses caution due to various uncertainties affecting the company, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activities worldwide, disruptions in the global supply chain, and restrictions on business operations. The company acknowledges the risks and uncertainties in the forward-looking statements provided, including potential adverse effects on the financial results due to factors beyond their control. These risks include changes in laws, economic conditions, foreign trade policies, and geopolitical conditions.

Step 2:
- The decrease in consolidated net sales is attributed to lower organic sales and business divestitures affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Gross profit decreased due to organic sales declines caused by the pandemic.
- The decrease in Selling, General, and Administrative expenses indicates cost mitigation actions and reduction in discretionary spending to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Equity income increased primarily due to higher income at partially-owned affiliates despite the challenges faced.

Step 3: The company has actively taken measures to mitigate costs and manage disruptions in its supply chain caused by the pandemic. While the company has seen a decline in demand and volumes due to COVID-19, it continues to deliver solutions and support to enhance safety and operational efficiency for its customers. Cost-cutting actions have positively impacted the company's results, improving its operational performance amidst the ongoing challenges.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. Despite cost mitigation actions taken by the company, the significant decline in net sales, gross profit, and challenges faced due to the pandemic present a high risk of financial distress. The uncertainties surrounding the resurgence of COVID-19 and its potential impact on economic activities further exacerbate the risk of bankruptcy for the company.
