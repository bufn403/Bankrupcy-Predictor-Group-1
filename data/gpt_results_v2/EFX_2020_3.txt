Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and realistic, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. For example, the text mentions, "The impact of COVID-19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our consolidated operating results in March 2020," showing a recognition of the challenges faced.

Step 2: The company acknowledges that while revenue has grown during the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, the impact of the global economy due to COVID-19 remains uncertain. They state, "Due to the uncertain effects of the global economy caused by the impact of COVID-19, there can be no assurances that revenues will continue to grow." This uncertainty regarding future financial performance indicates some level of risk.

Step 3: Despite revenue growth in certain segments like USIS and Workforce Solutions, revenue declines were experienced in most other vertical markets internationally. It is mentioned that, "Internationally, all countries in which we operate experienced revenue declines, across most vertical markets." This shows a mixed performance across different markets.

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious sentiment, uncertainties due to COVID-19, and the mixed performance across different markets, the company appears to have medium risk of bankruptcy. The acknowledgment of revenue declines in multiple international markets and the ongoing impact of the pandemic suggest potential challenges ahead. Additionally, the focus on managing costs and uncertainties related to future economic recovery indicate a certain level of financial risk.
