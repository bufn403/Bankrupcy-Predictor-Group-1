Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of optimism and caution. The company highlights revenue growth in certain areas but also mentions challenges, such as slower revenue growth in web solutions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain industries. Therefore, the tone can be seen as cautious.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0978 - This ratio indicates that the company has a relatively low working capital to support its total assets, which may suggest potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.2493 - This ratio signifies that a significant portion of the company's total assets is tied up in retained earnings, indicating some stability and long-term profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0677 - This ratio suggests that the company's EBIT generated from its total assets is relatively low, which could imply efficiency or profitability challenges.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.3850 - This ratio shows that the company generates a good amount of revenue relative to its total assets, indicating some level of operational efficiency.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, we see a mixed picture. While there are positive aspects such as revenue growth in certain areas and stable retained earnings, the mention of challenges and slower growth in some segments along with lower EBIT to total assets ratio indicates potential profitability and efficiency issues. The company seems to be navigating through a period of uncertainty due to the pandemic, impacting different divisions differently.

Step 4: Considering the cautious tone of the management's discussion, the mixed financial ratios, and the overall uncertain outlook due to the ongoing pandemic, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. It shows signs of both strength and vulnerability, requiring careful monitoring of its financial health and strategic decisions.
