Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is a mixture of caution and optimism. While there are mentions of challenges due to COVID-19 and deferral of elective procedures, there is also a focus on prudent measures taken to maintain financial stability, such as cost reductions and access to capital. For example, "We have taken prudent measures in an effort to maintain an adequate financial profile to have access to capital to fund the business during these unprecedented times."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio is 0.0815, indicating a relatively low working capital in proportion to total assets. This suggests potential liquidity challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The ratio is 0.4831, showing that a significant portion of total assets is tied up in retained earnings. This can indicate stability but also limits flexibility.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio is 0.0590, indicating that earnings before interest and taxes are relatively low compared to total assets, which might signal operational inefficiencies.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio is 0.3440, indicating that total revenue generated is 34.4% of total assets, which may be less than ideal for sustained growth and profitability.

Step 3:
Combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, it appears that the company has faced challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 on elective procedures, leading to a decrease in net sales and overall financial performance. The measures taken to reduce costs and maintain access to capital are positive signs but the ratios suggest areas of concern such as liquidity, profitability, and operational efficiency.

Step 4:
Based on the cautious tone of the management's discussion, the financial ratios indicating potential challenges in liquidity and profitability, and the overall outlook of facing uncertainties due to COVID-19, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The mix of positive actions taken and existing financial ratios that point to areas of concern contribute to this assessment.
