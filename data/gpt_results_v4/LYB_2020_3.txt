High

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is pessimistic. The company experienced a significant decline in revenues and EBITDA across its segments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The discussion highlighted challenges such as lower margins driven by market conditions, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and inventory valuation charges due to price declines of raw materials and finished goods.

Step 2: 
- Revenue Decrease: Revenues decreased by $1,946 million and $6,732 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decline was attributed to lower sales prices correlating with decreased crude oil prices, leading to an overall decrease in revenue.
- Cost of Sales: Cost of sales also decreased by $1,384 million and $4,610 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs.

Step 3: The company faced challenges such as lower sales prices, reduced demand due to the pandemic, and adverse impacts on margins, resulting in significant revenue and EBITDA declines. The impairment charges, inventory valuation charges, and lower operating income signify a struggling financial performance in the given period.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The pessimistic sentiment, significant declines in revenues and EBITDA, along with challenges highlighted in the discussion, suggest a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. The adverse market conditions, ongoing pandemic impacts, and impairment charges indicate financial distress and difficulties in maintaining profitability and liquidity, pointing towards a heightened risk of insolvency in the near future.
