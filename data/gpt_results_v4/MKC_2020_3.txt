Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the impact of COVID-19 on their operations and financial results but showing resilience in adapting to changing consumer behaviors and shifting demand patterns. The company has identified priorities to navigate through the uncertainties posed by the pandemic, focusing on employee safety, maintaining financial strength, and emerging stronger post the pandemic.

Step 2:
- Sales Growth: The company experienced an increase in sales during the nine months ended August 31, 2020, driven by the sustained preference for home cooking, which boosted sales in their consumer segment despite decreased demand in the flavor solutions segment due to government mandates affecting certain customers.
- Gross Profit Margins: The gross profit margins increased for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2020, primarily due to favorable sales mix and cost savings from their Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, partially offset by increased costs related to COVID-19 measures affecting productivity.

Step 3: While the company has seen an increase in sales and gross profit margins despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the ongoing impact of the pandemic on global economic conditions and consumer behaviors remains uncertain. The company's ability to adapt to changing demand and maintain profitability amidst shifting market dynamics indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy as the effects of the pandemic continue to linger.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to grow sales, improve gross profit margins, and adapt to evolving consumer demands under the cloud of COVID-19 uncertainties positions them in a somewhat stable financial state. However, the continued impact of the pandemic on their operations and the broader economic landscape introduces considerable risks that could affect their financial stability in the medium term.
