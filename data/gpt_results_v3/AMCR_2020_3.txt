Final Decision: Low

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, Amcor highlights its ability to adapt and respond to the situation. For example, "We believe we are well-positioned to continue to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic." The company also emphasizes its commitment to employee safety and operational continuity.

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) = 0.0489: This ratio indicates the company has positive working capital, suggesting it has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is a positive sign for financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) = 0.0509: A low value for this ratio might indicate that the company is not retaining enough earnings, but in this case, it is in line with industry averages.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) = 0.0906: This ratio shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets, and a value above 0.0 is generally considered favorable.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) = 0.8642: This ratio indicates that the company is generating significant revenue relative to its total assets, which is a positive indicator of efficiency.

Step 3: When combining the insights from the text analysis (positive outlook despite challenges) with the financial ratios (positive working capital, decent earnings to assets ratio, and high revenue to assets ratio), it suggests that Amcor had a successful quarter despite the COVID-19 challenges. The company's ability to adapt and generate revenue efficiently bodes well for its financial health.

Step 4: The above analysis leads to the conclusion that Amcor has a low risk of bankruptcy. The company's cautious optimism, combined with positive financial ratios, indicates a stable financial position and adaptability to external challenges.
