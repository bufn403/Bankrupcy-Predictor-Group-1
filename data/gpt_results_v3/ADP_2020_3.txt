Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While the company acknowledges the impact of the global pandemic, they highlight their efforts to adapt and provide support to clients. For example, they mention, "We are executing well considering the ongoing headwinds related to COVID-19" and "Our financial condition remains solid." This indicates a cautious but positive outlook.

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0117: This ratio being negative suggests potential short-term financial strain.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.4339: This indicates a moderate level of retained earnings relative to total assets, which is a positive sign.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0920: EBIT to Total Assets ratio of 0.0920 shows a decent return on assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.3374: Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio is healthy at 0.3374, indicating good revenue generation relative to assets.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the text and the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the pandemic, as mentioned in the text. The negative working capital to total assets ratio indicates a potential liquidity issue. However, the positive retained earnings to total assets ratio and decent EBIT to total assets ratio suggest some financial stability. The total revenue to total assets ratio shows strong revenue generation efficiency.

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the management's discussion, the mix of financial ratios pointing to both positive and concerning aspects, and the challenging business environment due to the pandemic, the company is classified as having Medium Risk of bankruptcy. The positive indicators are somewhat countered by the negative working capital ratio and the uncertainties mentioned in the text regarding the ongoing situation.
