Step 1: The company is a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products, focusing on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined corporate management to drive long-term shareholder value. The discussion mentions how the operations were designated as critical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and the proactive safety measures implemented for employees, reflecting a cautious yet optimistic outlook.

Step 2: 
- Sales Volume and Revenue: The company experienced strong demand for fertilizer products in the first nine months of 2020, with shipments increasing compared to the same period in 2019, despite facing challenges like weather-related delays and lower supply availability for certain products.
- Cost Management: The company successfully managed its costs, with a decrease in the cost of sales due to lower natural gas costs, partially offset by higher costs related to plant turnaround and maintenance activities.
- Financial Performance: The company reported a net loss in the third quarter of 2020 compared to net earnings in the same period of 2019, primarily attributed to lower selling prices affecting gross margin.

Step 3: The company adapted well to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining operations, meeting customer demand, and implementing safety precautions for employees. The significant increase in sales volume in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 indicates a resilient business model. The effective cost management strategy, especially in reducing natural gas costs, further contributes to the company's stability.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. Despite a temporary net loss in the third quarter of 2020, the company's ability to maintain and even increase sales volume, manage costs efficiently, and address operational challenges during the pandemic demonstrate a stable financial position. The company's proactive measures, strong demand for its products, and effective cost management indicate a low risk of bankruptcy in the foreseeable future.
