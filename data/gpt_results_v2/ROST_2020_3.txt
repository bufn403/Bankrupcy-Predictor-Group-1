Step 1: The sentiment in the management discussion section is mostly pessimistic due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. For example, the text states, "The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption have had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows in fiscal 2020."

Step 2: The relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion show significant declines in sales due to store closures and reduced customer demand caused by the pandemic. For instance, "Sales for the nine month period ended October 31, 2020, decreased $3.3 billion, or 28.8%, compared to the nine month period ended November 02, 2019." These numbers indicate a struggling quarter.

Step 3: The company acknowledges challenges in clearing aged inventory through markdowns and the uncertain consumer demand. While there was an improvement in sales in the third quarter, the ongoing impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior remains uncertain. The text mentions, "Despite the initial surge in customer demand as our stores reopened, we expect customer demand to be generally suppressed for an extended period."

Step 4: Based on the overall pessimistic sentiment, significant declines in sales, ongoing challenges in consumer demand, increased operating costs related to the pandemic response, and the need for debt refinancing and cost-cutting measures, the company is likely facing a medium risk of bankruptcy. The text highlights the company's efforts to enhance financial liquidity through borrowing, refinancing, suspending dividends, and reducing expenses, all of which suggest a need to bolster financial stability due to the challenging conditions faced by the company.
