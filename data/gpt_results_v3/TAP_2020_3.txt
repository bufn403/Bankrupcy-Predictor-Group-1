Final Decision: Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment from the management discussion is a mix of optimistic and cautious tone. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but also highlights strategic moves and progress made despite the adversities.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets ratio (-0.047) indicates potential liquidity challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio (0.284) shows a decent portion of assets funded by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): EBIT to total assets ratio (0.056) suggests a moderate ability to generate earnings from assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): Total revenue to total assets ratio (0.444) indicates a high proportion of revenue generated compared to total assets.

Step 3: Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic as mentioned in the text, the financial ratios show a mixed picture. The negative working capital to total assets ratio raises concerns about liquidity. However, the positive retained earnings to total assets ratio and total revenue to total assets ratio indicate a strong revenue generation capability. 

Step 4: Considering the cautious outlook in the management discussion, combined with the mixed financial ratios, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The liquidity challenges indicated by the negative working capital ratio and the ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic contribute to this assessment. Successes in revenue generation and strategic moves provide some stability, but the overall risk level remains medium.
