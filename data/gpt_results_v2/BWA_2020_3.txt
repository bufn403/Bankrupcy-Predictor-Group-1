Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on the business. The management acknowledges the adverse effects of COVID-19 on their sales, operations, and profitability.

Step 2: In the three months ended September 30, 2020, the net sales increased by 1.7%, but the gross profit and gross margin decreased compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales indicates potential inefficiencies in managing costs.

Step 3: Even though the company saw improvements in revenue and profitability in the third quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose risks for the future. The company emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the full impacts of COVID-19 on their financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainties regarding future impacts, the company is at medium risk of bankruptcy. While they have taken temporary cost-cutting measures and have strong liquidity with a $3,621 million balance, the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 could lead to adverse effects in the future. The decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and the lower Adjusted EBIT margins further signal potential financial difficulties ahead. Despite the liquidity position, the overall market conditions and the company's ability to adapt to ongoing challenges suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy.
