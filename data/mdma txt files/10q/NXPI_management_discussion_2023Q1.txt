The following table presents operating income for each of the three month periods ended April 2, 2023 and April 3, 2022, respectively:
Revenue for the three months ended April 2, 2023 was $3,121 million compared to $3,136 million for the three months ended April 3, 2022, a decrease of $15 million or 0.5%. NXP experienced lower demand in the Industrial IoT and the Mobile end markets and higher demand in NXP’s Automotive and Communication Infrastructure & Other end markets versus the year ago period.Revenue by end market was as follows:
Revenue by sales channel was as follows:
Revenue by geographic region, which is based on the customer’s shipped-to location was as follows:
The year-on-year change in revenues  was driven by a decline in shipment volumes, offset by higher average selling prices due to increased input costs from its suppliers which were passed along to end customers. When aggregating all end markets together, and reviewing sales channel performance, revenues through direct OEM and EMS customers was $1,594 million, an increase of 12.9% versus the year ago period. Revenues through NXP's third party distribution partners was $1,491 million, a decrease of 11.3%. From a geographic perspective, revenue declined in China and to a lesser extent in Asia Pacific, while revenue increased across the EMEA regions and  the Americas regions. Revenue in the Automotive end market was $1,828 million, an increase of $271 million or 17.4% versus the year ago period. The increase in Automotive revenue can be attributed to growth in automotive processing, advanced analog, automotive application processors and radar in support of the secular shift of electrification, and advanced driver safety and assistance. Revenue in the Industrial & IoT end market was $504 million, a decrease of $178 million or 26.1% versus the year ago period. Within the Industrial & IoT market the year-on-year decline was driven by lower demand across the entire product portfolio. Revenue in the Mobile end market was $260 million, a decrease of $141 million or 35.2% versus the year ago period. Declines within the Mobile end market were due to lower demand of our secure embedded transaction solutions, along with the company’s advanced analog high-speed interfaces and embedded power solutions. Revenue in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market was $529 million, an increase of $33 million or 6.7% versus the year ago period. The increase in revenue was due to increase demand of our network edge equipment, RFID tagging solutions, and transit and access solutions. Offsetting these positive growth trends were declines in demand for the company’s RF Power products, wireless access point solutions and smart antennae products.
Gross profit for the three months ended April 2, 2023 was $1,770 million, or 56.7% of revenue, compared to $1,777 million, or 56.7% of revenue for the three months ended April 3, 2022, with increases in pricing offsetting increases in our foundry, subcontractor and other supplier sourcing costs.
R&D costs for the three months ended April 2, 2023 increased by $59 million, or 11.4%, when compared to the three months ended April 3, 2022 mainly driven by:+ higher personnel-related costs;+ higher restructuring costs; and- lower variable compensation costs.
SG&A costs for the three months ended April 2, 2023 increased by $29 million, or 11.6%, when compared to the three months ended April 3, 2022 mainly due to:+ higher legal expense;+ higher personnel-related costs;+ higher restructuring costs; and- lower variable compensation costs.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $50 million, or 37.0%, when compared to the three months ended April 3, 2022 driven by: - certain intangibles became fully amortized during 2022.
The following table presents the details of financial income and expenses:
Interest income increased due to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent by a higher level of cash.
Interest expense increased due to several debt restructurings, issuance of $1.5 billion of new debt and repayment of $900 million of debt in the second quarter of 2022.
Other, net, mainly increased due to higher foreign currency results (a loss of $5 million) and fair value adjustments in equity securities.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, NXP was in a position to make a reliable estimate of its annual effective tax rate. This estimated annual effective tax rate ("EAETR") is then applied to the year-to-date Income (loss) before income taxes excluding discrete items, to determine the year-to-date benefit (provision) for income taxes. The income tax effects of any discrete items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the year progresses, the Company continually refines the EAETR based upon actual events and the apportionment of our earnings (loss). This continual estimation process periodically may result in a change to our EAETR for the year. When this occurs, we adjust on an accumulated basis the benefit (provision) for income taxes during the quarter in which the change occurs.Our provision for income taxes for 2023 is based on our EAETR of 17.0%, which is lower than the Netherlands statutory tax rate of 25.8%, primarily due to tax benefits from the Netherlands and foreign tax incentives. The effective tax rate of 15.9% for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the EAETR due to the income tax benefit for discrete items of $8 million. The discrete items are primarily related to changes in estimates for previous years and the impact of foreign currency on income tax related items. The effective tax rate of 14.8% for the first quarter of 2022 was lower compared to the current period due to higher foreign tax incentives as a result of an increase in qualifying investments and also due to a different mix of the benefit (provision) of income taxes in the locations that we operate in.
We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations. We continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, our cash balance was $3,930 million, an increase of $85 million compared to December 31, 2022. Taking into account the available amount of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility of $2,500 million, we had access to $6,430 million of liquidity as of April 2, 2023. We currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements, for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases, dividends and strategic investments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current available sources of funds (including cash and cash equivalents, RCF Agreement of $2.5 billion, plus anticipated cash generated from operations) will be adequate to finance our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next twelve months.
At April 2, 2023, our cash balance was $3,930 million of which $234 million was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner.
Our cash outflows for capital expenditures were $251 million in the first three months of 2023, compared to $280 million in the first three months of 2022.
Under our Quarterly Dividend Program, interim dividends of $0.845 per ordinary share were paid on January 6, 2023 ($219 million) and dividends of $1.014 per ordinary share were paid on April 5, 2023.
Our total debt amounted to $11,167 million as of Q1 2023, an increase of $2 million compared to December 31, 2022 ($11,165 million), with net debt amounting to $7,237 million.
Our cash and cash equivalents during the first three months of 2023 increased by $83 million (excluding the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash position of $2 million) as follows:
For the first three months of 2023 our operating activities provided $632 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $623 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $326 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(315) million. Adjustments to net income (loss) includes offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $283 million, share-based compensation of $99 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(62) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $196 million increase in inventories due to increased production levels in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, $138 million increase in receivables and other current assets due to the profile and timing of revenue by sales channel directly impacting outstanding receivables at the end of the period, $33 million increase in other non-current assets due to prepayments to secure long-term production supply; partially offset by $52 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of timing related to payments.For the first three months of 2022 our operating activities provided $856 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $666 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $352 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(164) million. Adjustments to net income (loss) includes offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $310 million, share-based compensation of $89 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(33) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $122 million increase in inventories due to increased production levels in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, $61 million increase in receivables and other current assets, $247 million increase in other non-current assets; partially offset by $266 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities.
Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $351 million for the first three months of 2023 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $251 million, $42 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, and $58 million for the purchase of investments.Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $329 million for the first three months of 2022 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $280 million and $43 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, $5 million for the purchase of equipment leased to others, $4 million for the net purchase of interests of businesses, partly offset by $2 million from the proceeds from return of equity investments and $1 million from the proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used for financing activities was $198 million for the first three months of 2023 was primarily driven by the $219 million dividend payment to shareholders, partially offset by the $33 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans. Net cash used for financing activities was $674 million for the first three months of 2022 was primarily driven by the $552 million purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit withholdings and $149 million dividend payment to shareholders; partially offset by the $28 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans.
