Step 1: The management's discussion provides a detailed overview of Evergy's operations, targeted efficiency improvements, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's Sustainability Transformation Plan aims to optimize value creation for stakeholders. The discussion acknowledges the challenges posed by the pandemic, such as reduced demand from industrial and commercial customers and the implementation of customer-friendly financial policies.

Step 2:  
- Utility Gross Margin: Evergy's utility gross margin analysis reveals a significant decrease, primarily due to unfavorable weather affecting retail sales and reduced commercial and industrial demand. The impact of COVID-19 on different customer segments is highlighted, with a noticeable shift in demand towards residential customers.
- Operating and Maintenance Expense: The company experienced a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, driven by factors like lower credit loss expenses, reduced labor expenses, and external costs related to rebranding. However, there were increases in voluntary severance expenses and advisor costs.

Step 3: Despite challenges from the pandemic affecting demand and shifting customer behaviors, Evergy's cost reduction targets and operational adjustments appear to be managing the ongoing impacts feasibly. The company's strategy to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs aligns with its goal of enhancing long-term shareholder value. The proactive approach to navigate through the crisis and the alignment with regulatory frameworks demonstrate adaptability and resilience.

Step 4: Low risk. Evergy's strategic plan, cost reduction initiatives, and response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic indicate a proactive and adaptive approach. While there are impacts on sales and expenses, the company's strategic alignment and efficiency measures suggest a lower risk of bankruptcy. The management's transparency about the challenges faced and the adjustments made to mitigate risks further support the assessment of low risk.
