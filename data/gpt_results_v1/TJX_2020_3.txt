Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears cautious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations. They mention temporary store closures, decrease in sales, challenges regarding consumer behavior, and uncertainties in the global economy. For example, they state, "The uncertainties in the global economy may also impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and service providers...These and other factors have had and may continue to have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows."

Step 2: The company has experienced a 28% decrease in net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the same period last year due to the impact of COVID-19. They also mention reducing capital spend and suspending their share buyback program to manage expenses. Additionally, they have negotiated rent deferrals and delayed capital spending to cope with the challenging situation. They state, "We have taken numerous steps to protect the health and well-being of our Associates and customers."

Step 3: The company has faced challenges such as reducing sales, increased operational costs to ensure health and safety measures, and markdowns on inventory. Despite the challenges, they have taken measures to strengthen their liquidity, such as borrowing funds and issuing long-term debt. They mention, "During the third quarter the Company generated positive operating cash flows and ended the third quarter with $10.6 billion of cash."

Based on the cautious sentiment, decreased sales, increased costs, and liquidity preservation actions taken by the company, I assess the risk of bankruptcy as medium. The company is facing significant challenges due to the pandemic, which have impacted their financial performance and operations. However, they have also implemented strategies to manage their liquidity and operational expenses, providing some level of stability in the medium term.
