Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: Analyze the overall sentiment of the management's discussion and headlines.
The Management Discussion text provided a comprehensive overview of the company's operations, financial performance, and strategic initiatives. The tone appeared to be a mix of optimistic and cautious due to the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and market dynamics. There was mention of market recovery, revenue growth, but also cost management strategies and potential risks related to Brexit, trade tensions, and LIBOR transition.

Step 2: Consider the financial ratios provided.
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0562 suggests a relatively low working capital position compared to total assets, indicating potential liquidity challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.2359 shows a moderate level of retained earnings compared to total assets, indicating some level of stability in the capital structure.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): -0.0058 indicates negative earnings before interest and taxes relative to total assets, highlighting potential profitability issues.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.1976 reflects the company's ability to generate revenue relative to its total assets, which is a positive sign.

Step 3: Combine insights from the text analysis with the financial ratios.
The management discussion highlighted both positive aspects like market recovery, revenue growth, and cost management efforts, but also mentioned challenges related to the pandemic, Brexit uncertainties, and cost-saving measures. The financial ratios indicate a mix of liquidity, profitability, and capital structure conditions. The company's revenue generation relative to total assets is positive, but challenges such as negative EBIT and relatively low working capital raise concerns.

Step 4: Output your final decision on the bankruptcy risk.
Based on the analysis of the text and the financial ratios, the company appears to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positive aspects such as revenue generation and retained earnings, the challenges related to profitability, liquidity, and external uncertainties contribute to this medium risk assessment. The company needs to monitor its financial performance closely and address the identified issues to mitigate the risk.
