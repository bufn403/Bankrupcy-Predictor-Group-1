Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears cautious and somewhat optimistic about navigating through challenges. While commodity prices have declined and uncertainty due to COVID-19 exists, the company emphasizes managing through the lower price environment, protecting the balance sheet, and highlighting financial strength and cost reduction efforts.
Quote: "We believe we can manage through this lower commodity price macro environment as our portfolio affords us the flexibility to respond to changing market conditions... Our primary focus remains on protecting our balance sheet and maintaining a strong liquidity position... We believe our financial strength, quality portfolio, and ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure better position us to navigate during this unprecedented time."

Step 2: The company has implemented various liquidity management measures and cost-cutting initiatives to navigate the challenging economic environment, with a focus on reducing debt and improving cash positions.
Quote: "At the end of the third quarter 2020, we had approximately $4.1 billion of liquidity... In August, we closed on the remarketing of $400 million sub-series B bonds... On October 1, 2020, we completed a cash tender for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of our outstanding $1 billion 2.8% 2022 Notes... Our cash provided from operations was commensurate with our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2020."

Step 3: The company has made adjustments to its capital budget, reduced spending, and suspended certain activities to align with the lower commodity price environment. While production volumes decreased and the net loss per share increased in the third quarter, the company remains focused on optimizing development plans.
Quote: "In light of the substantial decline in commodity prices and oversupply in the market... we further reduced our full year 2020 capital spending budget to $1.2 billion... This revised Capital Budget represents a 50% reduction of our original budget... we believe our full year production volumes will be between 375 mboed to 390 mboed."

Based on the cautious but strategic approach taken by the company in response to challenging market conditions, the medium risk classification is appropriate. The company is actively managing its liquidity, reducing costs, and adjusting its capital expenditures to mitigate risks, but the future remains uncertain given the volatile commodity prices and ongoing impact of COVID-19.
