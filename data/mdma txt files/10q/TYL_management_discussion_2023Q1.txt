A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.
We provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of public sector entities. We provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”), transaction-based services primarily related to digital government services and online payment processing, and electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. In addition, we provide professional services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. Additionally, we provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.We provide our software systems and related professional services through six business units, which focus on the following products:•financial management, education and planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;•financial management, municipal courts, planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;•courts and justice and public safety software solutions; •property and recording solutions;•platform solutions including case management and business process management; and•digital solutions including payments and government services. In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting, we report our results in two reportable segments. The Enterprise Software ("ES")  reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as: financial management and education; planning, regulatory and maintenance; courts and justice; public safety; and property and recording solutions.  The Platform Technologies ("PT") reportable segment provides public sector entities with software solutions to perform transaction processing, streamline data processing, and improve operations and workflows such as platform solutions and digital solutions.We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment operating income. We define segment operating income for our business units as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating loss also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference.
On October 31, 2022, we acquired Rapid Financial Solutions, LLC (Rapid), a provider of reliable, scalable, and secure payments with best-in-class card issuance and digital disbursement capabilities. On February 8, 2022, we acquired US eDirect Inc. (US eDirect), a leading provider of technology solutions for campground and outdoor recreation management. US eDirect and Rapid are operated as a part of the digital solutions business unit and the results of US eDirect and Rapid from their respective dates of acquisition are included with the operating results of the PT segment.
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, total revenues increased 3.5%, compared to the prior period. Excluding the 2023 incremental impact of recent acquisitions, revenues increased 2.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period. Subscriptions revenue grew 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period, primarily due to an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements, along with growth in our transaction-based revenues such as e-filing and online payment services, offset by the decline in COVID pandemic related transaction-based revenue. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, subscriptions revenue increased 11.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period. Subscriptions revenue from recent acquisitions contributed 2.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.Our backlog as of March 31, 2023, was $1.85 billion, a 5.1% increase from last year. Our total employee count increased to 7,229 at March 31, 2023, including 50 employees who joined us through acquisitions completed since March 31, 2022, from 6,959 at March 31, 2022.
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of GAAP for the interim period and require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, and share-based compensation expense. As these are condensed financial statements, one should also read expanded information about our critical accounting policies and estimates provided in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
As of January 1, 2023, we have elected to no longer report the appraisal services revenue and related costs as separate categories in the statement of income due to less significance on our overall operating results. Therefore, we have combined the appraisal services revenue category with the professional services revenue category; and the related cost of revenue category for appraisal services is now combined with the cost of revenue category related to subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services on the condensed consolidated statements of income for all reporting periods presented.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the three months ended March 31($ in thousands):
Subscriptions revenue consists of revenue derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services and payment processing. We also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. E-filing revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements.______________________________________1Excludes the 2023 incremental impact as a result of not having the recent acquisition for a full fiscal year.25Subscriptions revenue grew 14% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period. Excluding the incremental impact of recent acquisitions, subscriptions revenue increased 12%. New SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the majority of the subscriptions revenue increase. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we added 145 new SaaS clients and 73 existing clients elected to convert to our SaaS model. Our mix of new software contract value for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was approximately 13% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 87% subscription-based arrangements compared to total new contract value mix in 2022 of approximately 20% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 80% subscription-based arrangements. Total subscriptions revenue derived from transaction-based fees was $153.9 million and $143.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $10.2 million, or 7.1% is attributable to growth in transaction-based fees of $12.7 million due to the increased volumes of online payments and e-filing services and the incremental impact of transaction-based fees from recent acquisitions of $6.2 million in the first quarter 2023. The increases in transaction-based revenue are offset by the decline of $8.7 million in COVID-pandemic related transaction-based revenues compared to prior period.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the three months ended March 31($ in thousands):
We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third-party software. Maintenance revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior period. Maintenance revenue declined mainly due to clients converting from on-premises license arrangements to SaaS, partially offset by annual maintenance rate increases and maintenance associated with new software license sales.
Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources. Annualized recurring revenue ("ARR") is calculated based on total recurring revenues for the current quarter multiplied by four. ARR was $1.58 billion and $1.45 billion as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. ARR increased 9.1% compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in subscriptions revenue resulting from an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our professional services revenue for the three months ended March 31($ in thousands):
______________________________________1Excludes the 2023 incremental impact as a result of not having the recent acquisition for a full fiscal year.26Professional services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software, converting client data, training client personnel, custom development activities, consulting and property appraisal outsourcing services. New clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide the related professional services. Existing clients also periodically purchase additional training, consulting and minor programming services.Professional services revenue decreased 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period, primarily attributed to lower revenues generated by the COVID pandemic-related rent relief services, which declined $11.9 million compared to prior period. The decline is partially offset by increased billable travel revenue as onsite services have increased post-pandemic.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the three months ended March 31($ in thousands):
Software licenses and royalties revenue decreased 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period. The decrease is primarily attributed to the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscription-based agreements compared to the prior period. Although the mix of new contracts between subscription-based and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year, we expect the decline in software license revenues will accelerate as we continue to shift our model away from perpetual licenses to SaaS. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract.
The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31($ in thousands):
______________________________________1Excludes the 2023 incremental impact as a result of not having the recent acquisition for a full fiscal year.27Subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services. Cost of subscriptions, maintenance and professional services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software, conversion of client data, training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development, on-going operation of SaaS, property appraisal outsourcing activities, digital government services, and other transaction-based services such as e-filing. Other costs included are interchange fees required to process credit/debit card transactions and bank fees to process automated clearinghouse transactions related to our payments business. The cost of subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased $9.6 million or 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the 2023 incremental impact from recent acquisitions of $4.4 million, cost of subscriptions, maintenance and professional services increased 2% due to higher personnel costs, including costs related to onboarding new professional services employees who are not yet billable; and duplicate hosting costs as we transition from our proprietary data centers to the public cloud. Excluding employees from recent acquisitions, our professional services staff grew by 180 employees since March 31, 2022, as we increased hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. Software licenses and royalties. Costs of software licenses and royalties primarily consist of direct third party software costs. We do not have any direct costs associated with royalties. The cost of software licenses and royalties for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased $0.9 million or 60% compared to the prior period due to higher third party software costs.Amortization of software development. Software development costs included in cost of revenues primarily consist of personnel costs. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the software’s remaining estimated economic life of, generally, three to five years.For the three months ended March 31, 2023, amortization of software development costs increased $1.4 million or 122% compared to the prior period and is attributable new capitalized software development projects going into service in the past year.Amortization of acquired software. Amortization expense related to acquired software attributed to business combinations is included with cost of revenues. The estimated useful lives of other intangibles range from five to 10 years. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, amortization of acquired software declined $4.3 million or 33% compared to the prior period due to assets becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter 2022, offset by amortization of new acquired software from recent acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2022.The following table sets forth a comparison of overall gross margin for the periods presented as of March 31:Three Months Ended20232022ChangeOverall gross margin42.4 %42.2 %0.2 %Overall Gross Margin. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, our overall gross margin increased 0.2%, compared to the prior period. Excluding the 2023 incremental impact from recent acquisitions of $1.3 million, overall gross margin was 42.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase of 0.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, in overall gross margin compared to the prior period is due to growth in subscriptions revenues and the decline in low margin COVID-related revenues and related costs. Also attributing to the increase in overall gross margin is the decline in amortization of acquired software expense compared to the prior period. The margin increases are partially offset by lower revenue from software licenses and maintenance, duplicate hosting costs as we transition from our proprietary data centers to the public cloud, and higher personnel costs.
Sales and marketing expense (“S&M”) consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for sales and marketing employees, as well as professional fees, trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our S&M expense for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands):Three Months EndedChange20232022$%Sales and marketing expense$37,103 $35,206 $1,897 5 %S&M as a percentage of revenues was 7.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 7.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. S&M expense increased approximately 5% compared to the prior period and is primarily attributed to higher commission expense as a result of higher sales volumes compared to the prior period.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense consists primarily of personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development as well as third party professional fees, travel-related expenses, insurance, allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of software development for internal use, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. The following table sets forth a comparison of our G&A expense for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands):Three Months EndedChange20232022$%General and administrative expense$72,360 $62,689 $9,671 15 %G&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 13.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. G&A expense increased approximately 15% compared to the prior period. The increase in G&A is primarily attributed to increases in amortization of software development for internal use, increases in travel-related expenses and other administrative costs, and higher personnel costs from increased employee headcount and share-based compensation expense. Our administrative staff grew by 23 employees since March 31, 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, stock compensation expense grew $2.8 million compared to prior year period, generally due to a higher number of share-based awards issued in the current period.  For the three months ended March 31, 2023, G&A expense also included $1.4 million related to lease restructuring and other asset write-offs.
Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development. The following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands): Three Months EndedChange20232022$%Research and development expense$26,987 $23,941 $3,046 13 %Research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate significant revenue. Research and development expense increased 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period, mainly due to a number of new Tyler product development initiatives across our product suites, including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses. Total research and development headcount increased by 26 employees since March 31, 2022.
Other intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price in the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that are allocated to acquired software and customer related, trade name, and leases acquired intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer related, trade name, and leases acquired intangibles is recorded as operating expense. The estimated useful lives of other intangibles range from one to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of other intangibles for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands):Three Months EndedChange20232022$%Amortization of other intangibles$18,407 $14,714 $3,693 25 %For the three months ended March 31, 2023, amortization of other intangibles increased compared to the prior period due to the impact of intangibles added with recent acquisitions and the acceleration of certain trade name intangibles due to branding changes in 2023.

The change in interest expense compared to the prior period is attributable to an increase in amortization expense related to debt issuance costs, resulting from our accelerated repayment of the term loans, coupled with an increase in interest rates compared to the prior period.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our other income, net, for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands):Three Months EndedChange20232022$%Other income, net$1,246 $364 $882 242 %Other income, net, is primarily comprised of interest income from invested cash. The change in other income, net, in the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior period is due to increased interest income generated from invested cash as a result of higher interest rates in 2023 compared to 2022.
The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31 ($ in thousands):
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the prior period, was principally driven by an increase in research tax credit benefits, offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards and liabilities for uncertain tax positions.The effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the tax benefits of research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards, offset by state income taxes, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and non-deductible expenses.
As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $130.8 million compared to $173.9 million at December 31, 2022. We also had $43.4 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities as of March 31, 2023. These investments have varying maturity dates through 2027 and are held as available-for-sale. As of March 31, 2023, we had $275.0 million outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Credit Agreement and one outstanding letter of credit totaling $1.5 million in favor of a client contract. We believe our cash on hand, cash from operating activities, availability under our revolving line of credit, and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs.The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the three months ended March 31:
Net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt or equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We currently believe that our cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.For the three months ended March 31, 2023, operating activities provided cash of $74.7 million. Operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of $30.9 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $38.1 million, non-cash share-based compensation expense of $27.9 million and non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $3.8 million. Working capital, excluding cash, decreased approximately $26.5 million mainly due to the decline in deferred revenue balances, timing of bonus payments, timing of payroll related tax payments, and decreases in operating lease liabilities and deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period. These decreases were offset by the timing of income tax payments and timing of collections of annual maintenance renewals and subscription renewal billings that are billed in the fourth quarter. In general, changes in deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year, but our largest renewal billing cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters. Subscription renewals are billed throughout the year.Days sales outstanding (“DSO”) in accounts receivable were 95 days at March 31, 2023, compared to 115 days at December 31, 2022, and 99 days at March 31, 2022. DSO is calculated based on quarter-end accounts receivable divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days. The decrease in DSO compared to December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, is attributed to improved collection efforts and timing of receipts from our government partners.Investing activities used cash of approximately $600,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2023. We invested $10.6 million and received $23.0 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2027. Approximately $9.1 million of software development costs were capitalized. Approximately $2.0 million was invested in property and equipment, including $744,000 related to real estate. We paid $1.9 million primarily related to a small acquisition completed during first quarter 2023. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of growth, particularly as we transition from our proprietary data centers to the public cloud. Financing activities used cash of $117.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily attributable to repayment of $120.0 million of term debt, partially offset by payments received from stock option exercises, net of withheld shares for taxes upon equity award and employee stock purchase plan activity. In February 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was originally announced in October 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2019. As of April 26, 2023, we have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. Share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock from time to time.As of March 31, 2023, we had $600 million in outstanding principal for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. On January 28, 2023, we amended our 2021 Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR reference rate with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) reference rate. Under our amended 2021 Credit Agreement, we had $275 million in outstanding principal for the Term Loans, no outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, and an available borrowing capacity of $500 million as of March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, we had one outstanding letter of credit totaling $1.5 million. The letter of credit, which guarantees our performance under a client contract, renews automatically annually unless canceled in writing and expires in the third quarter of 2026. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repaid $120.0 million of the Term Loans under amended 2021 Credit Agreement.In the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, we paid interest of $6.8 million and $4.1 million. See Note 8, "Debt," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussions of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2021 Credit Agreement. We received income tax refunds, net of taxes paid of $548,000 and paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $393,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, stock option exercise activity generated net tax benefits of $703,000 and reduced tax payments accordingly, as compared to $3.0 million in the same period in 2022.For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174. The requirement temporarily increases our U.S. federal and state cash tax payments and reduces cash flows in fiscal year 2023 and future years until the amortization deduction normalizes. Subsequent to March 31, 2023, we have paid approximately $66.9 million of income taxes related to Section 174.We anticipate that 2023 capital spending will be between $63 million and $65 million, including approximately $37 million related to real estate and approximately $37 million of software development. We expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. We also expect cash tax payments to be higher as a result of IRC Section 174. Capital spending and cash tax payments are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to pursue such opportunities, which could require significant commitments of capital, we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed. We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation and other equipment. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements and they expire from one to 12 years. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to six years.Other than the accelerated repayment of $120.0 million of the Term Loans under the amended 2021 Credit Agreement, there were no material changes to our future minimum contractual obligations since December 31, 2022, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023. Our estimated future obligations consist of debt, uncertain tax positions, leases, and purchase commitments as of March 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8, “Debt,” Note 12, “Income Tax,” Note 15, “Leases,” and Note 16, “Commitment and Contingencies,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for related discussions.
