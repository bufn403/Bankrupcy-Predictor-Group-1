Decision: Medium Risk

Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While the company addresses the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and legal proceedings related to driver classification, they also highlight efforts to adapt to the situation and launch new services. Overall, the tone is cautious but proactive.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0476 - This ratio is low, indicating a relatively small amount of working capital in comparison to total assets. It suggests potential liquidity challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.7906 - A negative value indicates that the company's total assets exceed its retained earnings, which may be a sign of accumulated losses.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0763 - The return on assets is positive but relatively low, indicating modest profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.9634 - This high ratio suggests efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: The financial ratios paint a picture of mixed financial health. While the company shows efficiency in revenue generation, there are concerns regarding working capital, retained earnings, and profitability. The negative retained earnings and relatively low EBIT indicate challenges in generating sustainable profits and maintaining adequate capital.

Step 4: Based on the sentiment of the management's discussion, the mixed financial ratios, and the company's efforts to adapt to the current circumstances, the overall assessment leans towards a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company faces challenges in terms of profitability and capital adequacy, but proactive measures and adaptability may help mitigate some of these risks.
