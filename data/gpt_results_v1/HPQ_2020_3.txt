Step 1: Analyze the overall sentiment of the management's discussion and whether it is optimistic or pessimistic.
The management's discussion contains a mix of positive and negative sentiments. While they highlight strategic focuses on profitable growth and investments in innovative solutions, they also acknowledge challenges related to market trends, competition, and global economic conditions. The mention of dynamic market trends, competitive pressures, and uncertainties reflects a cautious tone.

Step 2: Observe relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion.
- "For the three months ended July 31, 2020, total net revenue decreased 2.1%... U.S. net revenue decreased 4.3%...Net revenue from international operations decreased 0.8%... The decrease in total net revenue was primarily driven by decline in Desktops, Supplies, Commercial Printing Hardware." 
- "For the nine months ended July 31, 2020, total net revenue decreased 4.5%... The decrease in total net revenue was primarily driven by decline in Supplies, Desktops, Commercial Printing Hardware."
- "For the three months ended July 31, 2020, gross margin decreased by 3.2 percentage points."
- "R&D expense decreased 13.1% for the three months ended July 31, 2020... SG&A expense decreased 16.0% and 7.6% for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2020, respectively..."

Step 3: Determine whether the numbers and figures represent a successful or failed quarter and if the conditions are likely to improve or worsen.
- The decrease in total net revenue and gross margin, along with reductions in R&D and SG&A expenses, indicate a challenging quarter with declining sales and profitability. The negative trends in net revenue and margins suggest a struggling financial performance.

Step 4: Output your final decision on whether the company has a low, medium, or high risk of bankruptcy in the future, taking the sentiment, numbers, and future outlook into account.
Based on the cautious sentiment, declining net revenue, reduced gross margins, and cost-cutting measures, the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy. The challenges highlighted in the discussion, along with the negative financial figures, point towards ongoing financial difficulties that could impact the company's sustainability in the future. Further monitoring of their ability to overcome these challenges is necessary to assess bankruptcy risks.
