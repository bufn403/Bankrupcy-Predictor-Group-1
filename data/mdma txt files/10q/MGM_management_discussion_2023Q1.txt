MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGP.”
Our primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to pay rent, fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders. We lease the real estate assets of our domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements and make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We also offer online gaming and sports betting through LeoVegas, a consolidated subsidiary, as well as through BetMGM, an unconsolidated affiliate.
On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and on February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of March 31, 2023, all of our properties were open and not subject to any COVID-19 related operating restrictions.
In February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan (“ADP”) previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka, Japan and our 50% owned venture. Agreements with Osaka on the construction of the planned integrated resort are required to be finalized within 90 days of the ADP approval.In April 2023, LeoVegas entered into an agreement to acquire the majority ownership of digital gaming developer, Push Gaming Holding Limited. The transaction is subject to regulatory and customary approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.
Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are: •Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slot handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-baccarat; and•Hotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) – hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.
The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results:
Consolidated net revenues were $3.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $2.9 billion in the prior year quarter, an increase of 36%. The current year quarter benefited from the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan, which was partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage and Gold Strike Tunica. The prior year quarter was negatively affected by a decrease in business volume and travel due to the spread of the omicron variant in the early part of the quarter. At MGM China, the current year quarter benefited from the removal of travel and entry restrictions in Macau. As a result, net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts increased 31%, Regional Operations increased 6%, and MGM China increased 130% compared to the prior year quarter.Consolidated operating income was $731 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $106 million in the prior year quarter. The current year quarter benefited from a $398 million gain related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica recorded in property transactions, net, the increase in net revenues, as discussed above, and an $85 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for the VICI and The Cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in April 2022 and May 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased compared to the prior year quarter due to the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022 and due to the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession becoming fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.
The following table presents a detail by segment of net revenues:
Las Vegas Strip Resorts net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for each revenue type increased compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan, partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage, and also due to the early part of the prior year quarter being negatively affected by the spread of the omicron variant.Las Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue was $501 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $475 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 5%. The following table shows key gaming statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:
Las Vegas Strip Resorts rooms revenue was $752 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $485 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 55%, due primarily to an increase in REVPAR.The following table shows key hotel statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:
Las Vegas Strip Resorts food and beverage revenue was $583 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $384 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 52%, and Las Vegas Strip Resorts entertainment, retail and other revenues were $341 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $318 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 7%.
Regional Operations casino revenue was $717 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $704 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 2%, due primarily to an increase in slot handle over the prior year quarter.The following table shows key gaming statistics for our Regional Operations:
Regional Operations rooms revenue was $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $56 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 20%, due to an increase in occupancy.Regional Operations food and beverage revenue was $112 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $91 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 23%, and Regional Operations entertainment, retail and other revenue, and reimbursed costs was $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $40 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 25%, as non-gaming amenities had not yet returned to pre-COVID-19 volumes in the comparative prior year quarter.
The following table shows key gaming statistics for MGM China:
MGM China net revenues were $618 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $268 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 130%, due to the current year quarter being positively affected by the removal of COVID-19 related travel and entry restrictions in Macau.
Corporate and other revenue primarily includes revenues from LeoVegas, other corporate operations, and management services. The increase in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter is primarily due to the acquisition of LeoVegas in September 2022.
The following table presents Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments. See Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and “Reportable Segment GAAP measure” below for additional information. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, discussed within “Non-GAAP measures” below.
Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $836 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $594 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 41%. Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin increased to 38.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 35.7% in the prior year quarter as the current year quarter primarily benefited from the increase in rooms revenues discussed above.
Regional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $313 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was flat compared to the prior year quarter. Regional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin decreased to 33.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 35.2% in the prior year quarter. The margin decreases were due primarily to an increase in contribution from lower margin non-gaming outlets and venues.
MGM China Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $169 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to Adjusted Property EBITDAR loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was due primarily to the increase in revenues, discussed above, and the prior year quarter included an $18 million charge related to litigation reserves.
The following table presents the financial results of Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations on a same-store basis for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, discussed within “Non-GAAP measures” below.
(1)Excludes the net revenues and Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan.(2)Excludes the net revenues and Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Mirage.
(1)Excludes the net revenues and Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica.
The following table summarizes information related to our share of operating loss from unconsolidated affiliates:
In April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of MGP were derecognized, which included MGP OP’s investment in MGP BREIT Venture.
Gross interest expense was $131 million and $196 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease from the prior year quarter is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the $1.0 billion 7.75% senior notes in March 2022, the derecognition of MGP OP’s senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022, and the repayment of the $1.25 billion 6% senior notes in March 2023, partially offset by an increase in the debt outstanding under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.
Other income, net was $46 million and $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate was a provision of 25.7% on income before income taxes and a benefit of 51.1% on loss before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The prior year quarter was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau from which we could not benefit.
“Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.
“Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, for Las Vegas Strip Resorts, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and of The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022, as applicable. For Regional Operations, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica for the periods prior to its disposition on February 15, 2023, as applicable.Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Company’s results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International to Adjusted EBITDAR:
As of March 31, 2023, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that owns the operations of MGM Springfield), MGM Sports & Interactive Gaming, LLC (the entity that owns our 50% interest in BetMGM), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including LeoVegas, MGM China, and each of their respective subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.The guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale associated with Gold Strike Tunica are included within current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, within the summarized financial information as of December 31, 2022.
Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $704 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $420 million in the prior year quarter. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and the change in cash paid (refunded) for taxes, net.Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.Cash provided by investing activities was $212 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to cash used in investing activities of $237 million in the prior year quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we received $439 million in net cash related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica, received $153 million in cash related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid, and made payments of $140 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $25 million to BetMGM, and made $218 million in net investments in debt securities. In comparison, in the prior year period we made payments of $102 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributed $125 million to BetMGM.
We made capital expenditures of $140 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, of which $6 million related to MGM China, for which the MGM China amount is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate and other entities of $134 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels.We made capital expenditures of $102 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022, of which $9 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $93 million primarily relate to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $2.4 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $1.8 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $18 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $484 million of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $1.0 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $118 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $1.8 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.25 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity, and aggregate repayments of $586 million on MGM China’s revolving credit facilities.During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $1.0 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, net repayments of $50 million on MGP OP’s revolving credit facility, and net borrowings of $32 million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we paid $484 million relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 11 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2023.During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired $1.0 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $1 million and MGP OP paid $141 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $59 million and MGP received $82 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.
We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, of which MGM China held $468 million, and we had $6.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $879 million outstanding under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or MGM China’s second revolving credit facility. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2022, MGM China amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity in May 2024.As of March 31, 2023, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $185 million to $195 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately $385 million to $395 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.We are required, as of March 31, 2023, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 8 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.We have planned capital expenditures expected over the remainder of the year of approximately $680 million to $690 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $135 million to $155 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects.We additionally have planned contributions to BetMGM over the remainder of 2023 of approximately $50 million. We continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as a commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. Additionally, we expect to have cash commitments of $200 million to $250 million over the remainder of 2023 relating to our Japan venture’s planned integrated resort in Osaka for which the amount and timing is subject to change and will be dependent upon funding of the venture from noncontrolling interests and the timing and amount of financing received by the venture.We also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $172 million, excluding excise tax. Repurchased shares were retired.
A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end.
In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.As of March 31, 2023, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 13% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:
In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. As of March 31, 2023, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.

Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:•our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments under our triple-net leases and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of the landlords of Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and MGM Grand Las Vegas could adversely affect our development options and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations;•current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed components of our rent payments, and to make planned expenditures;•restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity;•the fact that we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes;•significant competition we face with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete;•the impact on our business of economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside;•the fact that we suspended our payment of ongoing regular dividends to our
