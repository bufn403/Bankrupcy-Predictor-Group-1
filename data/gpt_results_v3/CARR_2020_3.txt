Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment from the management's discussion seems to be a mix of caution and adaptation to challenging circumstances, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. While they are taking measures to mitigate risks and preserve liquidity, there are mentions of lower demand and economic slowdowns attributed to the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The working capital to total assets ratio is 0.3622, indicating that the company may have some challenges in covering its short-term liabilities with current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio is 0.2008, suggesting that a significant portion of the company's total assets may be financed by sources other than retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to total assets ratio is 0.0745, indicating that the company's earnings before interest and taxes relative to total assets are relatively low.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The total revenue to total assets ratio is 0.6733, showing that the company generates a substantial amount of revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: The company's financial ratios suggest a moderate level of risk. While the company is generating significant revenue relative to its assets, the low EBIT to total assets ratio and relatively low working capital to total assets ratio indicate potential financial challenges. The impact of COVID-19 on demand and the need for cost containment initiatives further contribute to the overall cautious outlook.

Step 4: Medium
Overall, the combination of cautious sentiment from the management's discussion, the financial ratios showing some financial strain, and the challenging economic environment due to COVID-19 lead to the assessment of a medium risk of bankruptcy for the company. It appears that the company is facing some financial hurdles that may require careful management and strategic decisions to navigate successfully.
