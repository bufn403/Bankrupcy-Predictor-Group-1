Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious and acknowledges the potential impact of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financials. For example, the filing mentions, "While we do not currently believe that the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a material adverse impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable, global economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our customers, which could impact our future ability to collect our accounts receivable." This cautious tone suggests a level of uncertainty and potential challenges ahead.

Step 2: The filing discusses cost-saving measures taken by the company, such as terminating temporary workers, reducing the workforce, deferring capital investments, and implementing a freeze on future acquisitions. It also outlines the costs associated with Project Summit and the expected benefits. This indicates that the company is actively managing its expenses and looking for efficiencies, which is a positive sign.

Step 3: The filing mentions anticipated total consolidated revenue declines for 2020 and attributes them to factors like organic service revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company expects low single-digit total revenue declines for the year, indicating a challenging financial outlook.

Overall, the cautious sentiment, cost-saving measures, and anticipated revenue declines suggest that the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company is proactively addressing challenges but still expects financial difficulties ahead due to external factors and operational changes.

Therefore, based on the cautious sentiment, cost-saving measures, and anticipated revenue declines outlined in the filing, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy.
