Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is optimistic. The company discusses its strategy to build enduring relationships with customers, deliver innovative technology, and empower innovators. For example, "We empower innovators to achieve the new possible - enabling them to discover first-in-kind solutions to complex design challenges, deliver tangible outcomes in record time, and make data-powered decisions." This indicates a positive outlook on the company's future.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0698 - This ratio being negative indicates that the company may have more liabilities than assets in the short term, which can be a warning sign for financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.2114 - A negative value here signals that the company has a high proportion of liabilities compared to its total assets, which could indicate financial distress.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1078 - A positive EBIT to Total Assets ratio is generally a good sign, as it shows the company is generating earnings from its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.5303 - This indicates that the company is generating a significant amount of revenue relative to its total assets, which is a positive sign.

Step 3: Combining the optimistic sentiment from the management discussion with the financial ratios, we see a mix of positive and concerning indicators. The positive outlook from the management is reflected in the high revenue generation relative to total assets. However, the negative values in Working Capital to Total Assets and Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratios are red flags for financial stability.

Step 4: Taking into account the overall sentiment, financial ratios, and outlook, the company falls in the medium risk category. While the company's high revenue generation is a positive sign, the negative working capital and retained earnings ratios suggest potential financial challenges that need to be addressed.
