Step 1: The managerial discussion provides a comprehensive overview of the company's operations and strategic focus. While the discussion primarily focuses on the company's capabilities and market positioning, it also highlights the potential risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the supply chain and business operations. The company adopts a proactive approach to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Revenue Growth: The company experienced a substantial 9.7% increase in total net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2020, driven by the addition of software-as-a-service product offerings and enterprise license agreement products. However, revenues outside the United States decreased slightly from the previous year.
- Cost Control: The management focuses on controlling the cost of revenues to maintain stable gross margins. Factors such as inventory obsolescence, component price increases, and supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may impact gross margins.
- Financing Activities: The company had significant cash and investments totaling $1,462.1 million as of December 31, 2020. The company used the cash received from financing activities for various purposes, including making principal payments on outstanding loans and repurchasing shares. The Revolving Credit Facility provides additional flexibility for liquidity needs.

Step 3: The company saw revenue growth due to new product offerings and enterprise agreements, but challenges in cost control and potential impacts from the pandemic on the supply chain and margins introduce medium risk. The increase in financing activities and reliance on credit facilities for capital signify financial prudence, but the potential fluctuations in effective tax rates and ongoing uncertainties may impact cash flows and liquidity, warranting medium risk assessment.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company demonstrates positive revenue growth, cash positions, and financing strategies, cost control challenges, risks associated with the pandemic, and potential impact on gross margins introduce uncertainties that could affect the company's financial stability. The reliance on credit facilities and the need for careful monitoring of key financial indicators suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy.
