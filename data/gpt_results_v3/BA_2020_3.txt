Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic. The text highlights the significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing issues related to the 737 MAX airplane on the company's business. It mentions challenges such as decreased demand, lower revenues, reduced earnings, and adverse impacts on liquidity. This negative outlook is reflected in statements such as "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel" and "We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to significantly impact revenues in future quarters."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0981519866872974 - This ratio indicates a relatively low level of working capital in proportion to total assets, which can signal potential liquidity issues or inability to cover short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.1988949873003824 - This ratio shows the extent to which the company's total assets are financed by retained earnings. A higher ratio is generally considered favorable for financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0033135783726972 - This ratio suggests a low profitability in relation to the total assets employed, indicating potential inefficiencies in asset utilization.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.5677896826555339 - This ratio indicates that the company generates revenue in relation to its total assets, but it does not provide insights into profitability.

Step 3: The combination of the negative sentiment in the management's discussion, along with the relatively low Working Capital to Total Assets ratio and low EBIT to Total Assets ratio, suggests a challenging financial quarter for the company. The text highlights ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced revenues, losses from operations, reduction in backlog, and overall uncertainties in the commercial airline industry. These factors contribute to a medium risk assessment for bankruptcy in the future.
