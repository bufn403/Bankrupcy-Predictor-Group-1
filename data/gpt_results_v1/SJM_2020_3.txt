Step 1: The tone of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and realistic. They acknowledge the impact of COVID-19 on their business and industry, stating, "The spread of COVID-19... has had, and will continue to have, an impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our business and industry." This acknowledgment of the ongoing challenges indicates a level of concern.

Step 2: The company reported positive net sales growth in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, particularly driven by increased consumer demand for their products related to at-home consumption. For example, they mentioned, "Net sales in the second quarter of 2021 increased $76.2, or 4 percent," and "Net sales in the first six months of 2021 increased $269.1, or 7 percent." This growth in sales is a positive sign for the company's financial performance.

Step 3: Despite facing challenges related to COVID-19 and changes in consumer behavior, the company managed to increase its operating income significantly. They mentioned, "Operating income increased $51.0, or 15 percent," and "Operating income increased $154.5, or 26 percent" for the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively.

Based on the cautious tone of the discussion, the positive sales growth, and the significant increase in operating income, the company shows signs of financial stability and adaptability to external challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the overall assessment leads to a low risk of bankruptcy for the company.
