Step 1: The management's discussion highlights the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Stryker's operations, financial results, and overall business outlook. It mentions that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the market, delays in deferrable medical procedures, and adverse effects on the company's operations, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.

Step 2:
- The company experienced a significant decrease in net sales during the nine months of 2020, reflecting the challenges posed by the pandemic. Net sales declined by 6.2% as reported and 5.8% in constant currency, primarily due to decreased unit volume and lower prices.
- Operating income margin decreased to 14.6% in the nine months of 2020 from 16.5% in 2019, showing the financial strain caused by the pandemic. The impact of the global response to COVID-19 resulted in an unfavorable business mix and lower sales volumes.
- The company undertook cost-saving measures due to the pandemic, but expenses like research, development, engineering expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses still increased in certain periods due to investments and lower sales volumes.

Step 3: The financial results for the nine months of 2020 indicate a significant negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on Stryker's operations and financial performance. Despite some recovery in the second and third quarters, the overall results show a decline in net sales, operating income margin, and net earnings compared to the previous year.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The substantial decrease in net sales, operating income margin, and net earnings, coupled with ongoing challenges and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, point towards a high risk of bankruptcy for Stryker. The financial strain caused by the pandemic, as reflected in the company's performance, suggests a precarious financial position that may lead to potential insolvency issues in the future.
