Step 1: The sentiment from the Management Discussion text appears mixed. While the company highlights its success in generating revenue and profitability, it also acknowledges the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business activities. It states, "We have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to address COVID-19." This indicates a recognition of challenges faced by the company.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) of 0.6515 suggests a relatively healthy liquidity position.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) of 0.5141 indicates that a significant portion of assets is funded by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) of 0.2269 shows a moderate profitability level in relation to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) of 0.5891 implies good efficiency in generating revenue relative to total assets.

Step 3: The company's financial ratios show a stable liquidity position, decent profitability, and efficiency in generating revenue. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, supply chains, and customer demand is acknowledged and could pose challenges. The text mentions an expected year-over-year decline in total revenue for the year ending December 31, 2020. While steps are being taken to address the situation, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's duration and impact on business activities could lead to increased risk.

Step 4: Considering the mixed sentiment in the Management Discussion, along with the stable financial ratios despite challenges posed by COVID-19, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The acknowledgment of negative impacts alongside the stability in financial ratios implies a cautious outlook for the company's future.
