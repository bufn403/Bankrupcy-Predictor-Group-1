Step 1: The management's discussion acknowledges the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial condition and operations. While there are mentions of benefits from increases in subscribers for streaming services, the overall tone is focused on the adverse effects of the pandemic, such as lower advertising revenues, production shutdowns, and delays impacting various aspects of the business.

Step 2: 
- Revenues decreased by 9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by lower demand in the advertising market and production shutdowns due to the pandemic.
- Operating income decreased by 7% for the same period and was impacted by restructuring charges and costs associated with other corporate matters.
- Net earnings and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from continuing operations decreased by 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, with adjusted net earnings and EPS decreasing by 18% and 17% respectively, primarily due to lower Adjusted OIBDA.
  
Step 3: The significant decline in revenues, operating income, net earnings, and EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2020, along with the acknowledgment of COVID-19-related challenges such as lower demand, production shutdowns, and reduced revenue from various business segments, indicates a failed quarter. The uncertainties related to the pandemic's ongoing impact on advertising revenues, content licensing, and theatrical releases further emphasize the challenging operational environment.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The company is facing substantial challenges due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its revenue streams, production activities, and financial performance. The significant declines in key financial indicators, coupled with uncertainties surrounding the return to normalcy in the advertising and entertainment industry, pose a high risk of bankruptcy for ViacomCBS Inc.
