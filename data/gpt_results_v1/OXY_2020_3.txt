Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautiously pessimistic. The filing mentions significant challenges such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil demand, the dramatic drop in oil prices, and the need for liquidity and debt management. For example, "In response to the dramatic drop in oil prices and the current macroeconomic environment, Occidental has taken significant measures to increase its near and mid-term liquidity and address near-term debt maturities."

Step 2: The filing provides specific figures and numbers reflecting the company's financial performance. It mentions a loss from continuing operations of $3.7 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $737 million for the same period in 2019. Additionally, Occidental reported a loss from continuing operations of $12.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to income from continuing operations of $529 million for the same period in 2019.

Step 3: The company's financial condition seems challenging as evidenced by the loss from continuing operations and the impact of asset impairments. Occidental has undertaken measures to address liquidity by reducing capital budgets, operating costs, and dividends. The filing states, "Occidental has: Reduced its 2020 capital budget...Made significant cuts to its 2020 operating and corporate costs...Reduced the quarterly common stock dividend..."

Step 4: Taking into consideration the cautious and somewhat pessimistic tone of the management's discussion, the reported losses, and the company's efforts to address liquidity issues and debt maturities by cutting costs, reducing dividends, and issuing new debt, the overall risk of bankruptcy for Occidental appears to be medium. The company faces significant financial challenges and uncertainties, as highlighted in the filing, which could indicate a higher risk compared to a company with a more stable financial position.
