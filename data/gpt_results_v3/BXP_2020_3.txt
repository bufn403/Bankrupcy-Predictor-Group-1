Decision: Medium

Step 1: The sentiment in the Management Discussion Text seems cautious and acknowledges the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the company highlights its competitive advantages, such as its diverse tenant base and long-term lease agreements, it also acknowledges the impact of the pandemic on its operations, stating, "Because of the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the pandemic, many existing and prospective tenants are deferring decisions on their office space needs as they focus on their employees’ safety, their companies’ liquidity and managing their businesses through the recession and economic recovery." This cautious tone indicates some level of uncertainty and potential risks.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0934
   - This ratio indicates the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its current assets. A value below 1 may suggest potential liquidity issues. In this case, the value of 0.0934 indicates a relatively low level of working capital compared to total assets, which could pose liquidity challenges.
   
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.0314
   - A negative value for this ratio suggests that the company's accumulated earnings are not sufficient to cover its total assets. This could indicate financial strain and potential difficulties in reinvesting in the business or supporting growth.
   
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0335
   - This ratio, which measures operating profitability relative to total assets, shows a relatively low return on assets. A higher value would indicate more efficient asset utilization.

- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.1258
   - This ratio indicates the company's ability to generate revenue relative to its total assets. The value of 0.1258 suggests that the company is generating revenue but may not be maximizing its asset efficiency.

Step 3: Combining the cautious sentiment expressed in the Management Discussion Text with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing some challenges, particularly in terms of liquidity (given the low Working Capital to Total Assets ratio) and profitability (indicated by the low Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio). The company's ability to weather the current market downturn and manage its balance sheet effectively will be crucial in navigating the uncertainties brought by the pandemic.

Step 4: Based on the cautious tone of the Management Discussion Text, the financial ratios pointing towards potential liquidity and profitability challenges, and the overall uncertain market conditions due to the pandemic, the company is classified as having a Medium risk of bankruptcy. It is imperative for the company to closely monitor its financial health, manage liquidity effectively, and adapt to the changing market dynamics to mitigate risks of potential financial distress.
