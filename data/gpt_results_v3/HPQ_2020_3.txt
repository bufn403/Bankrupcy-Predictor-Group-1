- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) is positive, showing a profitability of 9.42%. While this is a positive sign, it's essential to consider the negative values of X1 and X2, indicating potential challenges in liquidity and retained earnings.

The mix of challenges and efforts to mitigate them, along with a mixed financial performance, indicates a need for careful monitoring of the company's financial health in the future.
