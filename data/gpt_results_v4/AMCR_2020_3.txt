Step 1: The management's discussion acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties surrounding its impact on the global economy and the company's operations. Despite having precautionary measures in place to protect employees and manage operations, the discussion points out the potential disruptions across the supply chain and volatile demand patterns that the company has experienced and may continue to face.

Step 2: 
- Net sales increased by $60 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020, from the same period in 2019, driven by favorable volumes and partially offset by unfavorable price/mix.
- Net income attributable to Amcor plc increased by $33 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to growth in sales volume, Bemis acquisition synergies, and reduced interest expenses.
- Adjusted EBIT from the Flexibles reporting segment increased by $21 million, driven by plant cost improvements, favorable volumes, and cost impacts, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix.

Step 3: Despite experiencing disruptions and volatility in customer order patterns, the company managed to increase net sales and net income, indicating some level of resilience in its operations. However, the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19 and potential disruptions in the supply chain could pose significant challenges in the future.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The company's reliance on end markets sensitive to economic cycles, coupled with the challenges posed by the pandemic on supply chain disruptions and volatile demand, signifies a high risk. Despite the company's efforts to manage operations and protect employees' health, the unpredictable nature of the situation and the potential for significant disruptions paint a concerning outlook for the company's financial stability.
