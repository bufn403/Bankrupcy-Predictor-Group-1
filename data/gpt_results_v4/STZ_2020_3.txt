Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion appears to be a mix of caution and optimism. Despite the positive language regarding the company's brand portfolio and market positioning, there are mentions of divestitures, impairment charges, and challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the discussion indicates that the company is adapting to changes in consumer trends and market dynamics while also facing constraints related to the pandemic.

Step 2: Observing the figures provided in the discussion:
- Net sales increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 due to volume growth and favorable impacts from pricing and product mix.
- Operating income increased significantly by 193% due to certain impairments in the same quarter of 2020 and volume growth in Beer net sales.
- The company realized a net income attributable to CBI and diluted net income per common share increase, mostly due to unrealized gains from investments in Canopy and volume growth.

Step 3: The company experienced positive growth in net sales and operating income in the third quarter of 2021, which is a good sign of financial performance. However, there were impairments and divestitures in the previous year that impacted comparisons. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the on-premise business and production activities may pose future challenges.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company has shown growth in net sales and operating income, the impact of impairments, divestitures, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic suggest some financial instability. The company's ability to adapt to changing consumer trends and maintain its market position is critical in mitigating bankruptcy risk.
