1. **Step 1:**
Analyzing the overall sentiment of the management's discussion, it appears to be pessimistic due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. For instance, the filing states, "Currently, no fully effective treatments or vaccines have been developed, and there can be no assurance as to if or when an effective treatment or vaccine will be discovered." This uncertainty surrounding the pandemic indicates a pessimistic outlook.

2. **Step 2:**
Observing relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion, the filing highlights significant decreases in operating revenues and net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, it mentions, "The decrease in operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was driven by decreases of $582.5 million, $422.9 million, $212.8 million, and $59.1 million from Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, our Las Vegas Operations, and Encore Boston Harbor, respectively." These substantial decreases indicate financial struggles.

3. **Step 3:**
Determining whether the numbers and figures represent a successful or failed quarter, it is evident that the conditions have worsened for the company. The filing mentions, "Our operations are generating extremely limited revenue," and discusses closures and reduced operations at various properties due to the pandemic. This signifies a challenging quarter with continuing adverse effects.

4. **Step 4:**
Based on the overall sentiment being pessimistic, significant decreases in revenues, net losses, and uncertainties related to the pandemic's future impact, it is reasonable to assess that the company has a **high risk** of bankruptcy. The combination of pessimism, financial downturns, and ongoing operational challenges due to COVID-19 paints a concerning picture for the company's financial health.
