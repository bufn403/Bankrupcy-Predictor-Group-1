The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements.
We are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. Our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world.We have grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, and continue to invest in new technology solutions and innovation, infrastructure to support our growing business and the ongoing consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. These investments include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloud-based solutions available to customers, along with migration of certain underlying technology platforms to cloud environments to enhance performance, improve speed to market and drive cost efficiencies. We also continue to execute on integration and other activities, such as combining business operations, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. We have furthered our business strategy through several recent key transactions, including the following:•On March 24, 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of EVO Payments, Inc. ("EVO") for total purchase consideration of $4.3 billion. EVO is a leading payment technology and services provider, offering an array of payment solutions to merchants ranging from small and middle market enterprises to multinational companies and organizations across the Americas and Europe. The cash portion of the purchase consideration was funded through cash on hand and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. •On April 26, 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business for approximately $1 billion, subject to final closing adjustments. In connection with the sale, we provided $675 million of seller financing and a first lien five-year $50 million secured revolving facility available from the date of closing of the sale. We recognized a loss on business dispositions in our consolidated statement of income of $244.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to the consumer business disposal group.•On April 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our gaming business for approximately $400.0 million, including $32 million of seller financing, and subject to final closing adjustments. We expect to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $100 million in the second quarter of 2023.•Our capital allocation priorities were supported by the successful issuance of new Euro-denominated senior notes and the launch of a new commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2023.◦On March 17, 2023, we issued €800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due March 2031 and received net proceeds of €790.6 million, or $843.6 million based on the exchange rate on the issuance date. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.◦In January 2023, we established a $2.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion on the revolving credit facility. The proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other general corporate purposes.Highlights related to our financial condition at March 31, 2023 and results of operations for the three months then ended include the following:•Consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased to $2,292.4 million compared to $2,156.3 million for the prior year. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes as a result of the increasing use of digital payment solutions, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.•Merchant Solutions segment and Issuer Solutions segment operating income and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effects of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued prudent expense management. These favorable effects were partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. •Consolidated operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included the unfavorable effects of the loss on business dispositions as described above and an increase in acquisition and integration expenses as compared to the prior year, primarily related to the acquisition of EVO.
We are exposed to general economic conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation, rising interest rates and health and social events or other conditions that affect the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect our financial performance. Certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. Consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses has been and may continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our consolidated revenues by approximately $30.4 million and decreased our operating income by approximately $10.7 million, calculated by converting revenues and operating income for the current year in local currencies using exchange rates for the prior year. A continued strengthening of the US dollar or other significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in an adverse effect on our future financial results; however, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results.We have reduced our interest rate risk through issuance of fixed rate debt in place of variable rate debt, including the effect of interest rate swap hedging arrangements to convert a significant portion of the eligible variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility to a fixed rate. However, inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial performance as a result of higher costs and/or lower consumer spending. In addition, continued inflation or a rise in interest rates could result in an adverse effect on our future financial results and the recoverability of assets. However, as the future magnitude, duration and effects of these conditions are difficult to predict at this time, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results. In addition, recent failures of several financial institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank, have created uncertainty in the global financial markets and a greater focus on the potential failure of other banks in the future. Although we do not have exposure to and did not experience losses as a result of these failures, we regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, which could affect our ability to access our cash or cash equivalents, our ability to provide settlement services or our customers' ability to access their existing cash to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The occurrence of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our future operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent filings we make with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
During 2022, as a result of the pending divestiture of our consumer business and changes in how the business is managed, we realigned the businesses previously comprising our Business and Consumer Solutions segment to include the business-to-business portion within our Issuer Solutions segment and the consumer portion forming our new Consumer Solutions segment. Our three reportable segments now are: Merchant Solutions, Issuer Solutions and Consumer Solutions. The presentation of segment information for the three months ended March 31, 2022 has been recast to align with the segment presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For further information about our reportable segments, see "Item 1. Business—Business Segments" within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, incorporated herein by reference, and "Note 15—Segment Information" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth key selected financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, this data as a percentage of total revenues and the changes between the periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior-year amount. The income statement data for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 is derived from the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 - Financial Statements.
NM = Not meaningful(1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.(2) Revenues, consolidated operating expenses, operating income (loss) and operating margin reflect the effects of acquired businesses from the respective acquisition dates and the effects of divested businesses through the respective disposal dates. See “Note 2—Acquisition” and “Note 3—Business Dispositions” for further discussion.(3) Operating loss for Corporate included acquisition and integration expenses of $87.8 million and $48.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 6.3% to $2,292.4 million compared to $2,156.3 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes as a result of the increasing use of digital payment solutions, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022.Merchant Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Merchant Solutions segment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 9.0% to $1,605.6 million compared to $1,473.0 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes as a result of the increasing use of digital payment solutions and growth in subscription and software revenue, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.Issuer Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Issuer Solutions segment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 6.2% to $570.9 million compared to $537.3 million for the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of $12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.Consumer Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Consumer Solutions segment for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $143.7 million compared to $169.1 million for the prior year. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were affected by reduced consumer spending and lower spending volumes as compared to the prior year.
Cost of Service. Cost of service for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $947.8 million compared to $957.2 million for the prior year. Cost of service as a percentage of revenues decreased to 41.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 44.4% for the prior year. Compared to the prior year, cost of service for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenues, which was more than offset by the favorable effects of lower amortization of acquired intangibles, as the consumer and gaming business assets classified as held for sale are not subject to amortization, and prudent expense management. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $301.3 million and $329.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by 26.7% to $1,043.1 million compared to $823.1 million for the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 45.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 38.2% for the prior year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in variable selling and other costs related to the increase in revenues, acquisition and integration expenses related primarily to the acquisition of EVO, higher compensation and benefits costs, including an increase in share-based compensation expense for retirement eligible executives and our CEO, whose departure was announced on May 1, 2023, and other costs related to the sale of the consumer business. Selling, general and administrative expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $101.4 million and $51.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.Corporate. Corporate expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $282.7 million compared to $160.3 million for the prior year. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the increase in acquisition and integration and share-based compensation expenses as described above. Corporate expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $87.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $48.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
Consolidated operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $56.7 million compared to $375.9 million for the prior year. Operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 2.5% compared to 17.4% for the prior year. Consolidated operating income and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and lower amortization of acquired intangibles as described above. We recognized a loss on business dispositions in our consolidated statement of income of $244.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to reduce the carrying amount of the disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell, including the effects of incremental negotiated closing adjustments, changes in the estimated fair value of the seller financing and the effects of the final tax structure of the transaction. Operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 also included the unfavorable effect of higher acquisition and integration and share-based compensation expenses as described above.
In our Merchant Solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued prudent expense management. These favorable effects were partially offset by incremental expenses related to continued investment in new product, innovation and our technology environments and the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In our Issuer Solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued prudent expense management, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In our Consumer Solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were unfavorably affected by the decline in revenues and higher costs related to the sale of the consumer business.
Interest and other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased to $122.9 million compared to $93.3 million for the prior year as a result of the increase in our average outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates on outstanding borrowings.
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reported a tax benefit of 57.0% of the reported loss before taxes compared to a tax expense of 18.4% of the reported income before taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included a higher benefit from foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized a tax benefit on the loss on business disposition at the applicable tax rate, whereas the earnings other than this discrete item were tax effected at the lower estimated annual effective tax rate. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which, among other things, implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases effective beginning January 1, 2023. We do not expect the corporate alternative minimum tax will have a material effect on our reported results, cash flows or financial position. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reflected excise taxes of $2.3 million within equity as part of the price of common stock repurchased during the period.
Net loss attributable to Global Payments was $11.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to net income of $244.7 million for the prior year, reflecting the changes in operating income noted above along with changes in equity in income of equity method investments.
Diluted loss per share was $0.04 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.87 for the prior year. Diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 reflects the changes in net income (loss).
We have numerous sources of capital, including cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations as well as various sources of financing. In the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows and borrowings, including the capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our capital allocation priorities are to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Our significant contractual cash requirements also include ongoing payments for lease liabilities and contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts, which primarily relate to software, technology infrastructure and related services. Commitments under our borrowing arrangements are further described in "Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and below under "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit." For additional information regarding our other cash commitments and contractual obligations, see "Note 7—Leases" and “Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while optimizing our cost of capital and financial position. To supplement cash from operating activities, we use a combination of bank financing, such as borrowings under our credit facilities, commercial paper program and senior note issuances, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. Our commercial paper program, established during the first quarter of 2023, provides a cost effective means of satisfying our short-term liquidity needs and is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. Finally, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card networks. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of debt or equity or by other means. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments. We believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the near and long term.At March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2,001.7 million. Of this amount, we considered $696.2 million to be available for general purposes, of which $61.2 million is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The available cash of $696.2 million does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("Merchant Reserves") and (iii) funds held for customers. Settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement-related cash balances are not restricted in their use; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. Merchant Reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant's agreement. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash as a Merchant Reserve strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors. Funds held for customers, which are not restricted in their use, include amounts collected before the corresponding obligation is due to be settled to or at the direction of our customers.We also had restricted cash of $147.3 million as of March 31, 2023, representing amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions at one of our Spain subsidiaries and funds held as a liquidity reserve at our Chilean and Greek subsidiaries. These balances are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use.Operating activities provided net cash of $599.5 million and $630.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which reflect net income adjusted for noncash items, including depreciation and amortization, charges associated with the loss on business dispositions and facility exit charges, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from the prior year was due to fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities that are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, including changes in settlement processing assets and obligations and accounts payable and other liabilities balances.We used net cash in investing activities of $4,206.8 million and $160.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash used for investing activities primarily represents cash used to fund acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and capital expenditures. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we used cash of $4,046.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for acquisitions. We made capital expenditures of $162.2 million and $156.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, infrastructure to support our growing business and the consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. These investments also include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloud-based solutions available to customers. We expect to continue to make significant capital investments in the business, and we anticipate capital expenditures to grow at a similar rate as our revenue growth for the year ending December 31, 2023. Financing activities include borrowings and repayments under our various debt arrangements, as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. Our borrowing arrangements are further described in "Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and below under "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit." Financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs, cash distributions made to our shareholders and cash contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Financing activities provided net cash of $3,610.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, and we used net cash in financing activities of $376.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022.Proceeds from long-term debt were $4,708.1 million and $1,529.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Repayments of long-term debt were $1,556.0 million and $1,176.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Proceeds from and repayments of long-term debt consist of borrowings and repayments that we make with available cash, from time-to-time, under our revolving credit facility, as well as scheduled principal repayments we make on our term loans, finance leases and other vendor financing arrangements. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we also had net borrowings of $1,048.6 million under our commercial paper program. See section "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" below for further discussion of our recent debt transactions. Activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of $281.4 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net borrowings from settlement lines of credit of $16.5 million.We repurchase our common stock mainly through open market repurchase plans and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase programs. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we used $206.6 million and $649.7 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2023, the remaining amount available under our share repurchase program was $1,295.7 million. We paid dividends to our common shareholders in the amounts of $65.8 million and $70.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We have $12.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which mature at various dates ranging from June 2023 to August 2052. Interest on the senior notes is payable annually or semi-annually at various dates. Each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time-to-time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture. On March 17, 2023, we issued €800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due March 2031 and received net proceeds of €790.6 million, or $843.6 million based on the exchange rate on the issuance date. We issued the senior notes at a discount of $2.8 million, and we incurred debt issuance costs of $7.2 million, including underwriting fees, fees for professional services and registration fees, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the notes in our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2023. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable annually in arrears on March 17 of each year, commencing March 17, 2024. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.
We have $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.000% convertible notes due 2029, which were issued during 2022 in a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners.The convertible notes bear interest at a rate of 1.000% per annum. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2023, to the holders of record on the preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively. The convertible notes mature on August 15, 2029, subject to earlier conversion or repurchase.
Our revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents, provides for an unsubordinated unsecured $5.75 billion revolving credit facility that matures in August 2027. We may issue standby letters of credit of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. The amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant. As of March 31, 2023, there were borrowings of $2,323.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were $2.4 billion.
In January 2023, we established a $2.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. As such, we could draw on the revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper notes that cannot be rolled over or refinanced with similar debt.Commercial paper notes are expected to be issued at a discount from par, or they may bear interest, each at commercial paper market rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used primarily for general corporate purposes but may also be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other purposes. As of March 31, 2023, we had borrowings under our commercial paper program of $1,048.6 million outstanding with a weighted average annual interest rate of 5.87%.
The convertible notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. The required leverage ratio was increased to 4.50 to 1.00 as a result of the qualifying acquisition of EVO, which will remain in effect for up to eight consecutive quarters with a gradual step-down to 3.75 to 1.00, and the required interest coverage ratio is 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of March 31, 2023.
In various markets where we do business, we have specialized lines of credit that are restricted for use in funding settlement. The settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding lines of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of March 31, 2023, a total of $82.6 million of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit. As of March 31, 2023, we had $482.3 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of $1.8 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were $994.9 million and $460.6 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 6.12% at March 31, 2023.
Redeemable noncontrolling interests - Redeemable noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries in Poland, Chile, and Greece relate to the portion of equity in each of those subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us, which is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests at each balance sheet date to reflect our estimates of the maximum redemption amounts with changes recognized as an adjustment to our additional paid-in capital or, in the absence of additional paid-in capital, to shareholders’ deficit. Such estimates are based on projected operating performance of the subsidiaries and the key assumptions used in estimating the fair values include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital. Refer to “Note 9—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests” in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further information.
From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. There were no new recently adopted accounting pronouncements or recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted during the period.
Some of the statements we use in this report, and in some of the documents we incorporate by reference in this report, contain forward-looking statements concerning our business operations, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular: our business strategy and means to implement the strategy; measures of future results of operations, such as revenues, expenses, operating margins, income tax rates, and earnings per share; other operating metrics such as capital expenditures; the effects of economic conditions on our business; statements about the benefits of our acquisitions or divestitures, including future financial and operating results, the company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, and the successful integration of our acquisitions or completion of anticipated benefits or strategic initiatives; and our success and timing in developing and introducing new services and expanding our business. You can sometimes identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plan," "forecast," "guidance" and similar expressions. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Although we believe that the plans and expectations reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements are based on a number of assumptions, estimates, projections or plans that are inherently subject to significant risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our plans and expectations will be achieved. Our actual revenues, revenue growth rates and margins, other results of operations and shareholder values could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict or control. Important factors, among others, that may otherwise cause actual events or results to differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements or historical performance include the effects of global economic, political, market, health and social events or other conditions; foreign currency exchange, continuing inflation and rising interest rate risks; difficulties, delays and higher than anticipated costs related to integrating the businesses of acquired companies, including with respect to implementing controls to prevent a material security breach of any internal systems or to successfully manage credit and fraud risks in business units; the effect of a security breach or operational failure on the Company's business; failing to comply with the applicable requirements of Visa, Mastercard or other payment networks or card schemes or changes in those requirements; the ability to maintain Visa and Mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship; the ability to retain, develop and hire key personnel; the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations; the continued availability of capital and financing; increased competition in the markets in which we operate and our ability to increase our market share in existing markets and expand into new markets; our ability to safeguard our data; risks associated with our indebtedness; our ability to meet environmental, social and governance targets, goals and commitments; the potential effects of climate change, including natural disasters; the effects of new or changes in current laws, regulations, credit card association rules or other industry standards on us or our partners and customers, including privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations; and other events beyond our control, and other factors presented in "Item 1A - Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent filings we make with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which we advise you to review. These cautionary statements qualify all of our forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our plans and expectations as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update or revise forward-looking statements at some time in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to our forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
