High

Step 1: The management's discussion contains several concerning factors that point towards a high risk of bankruptcy. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highlighted, and the company incurred substantial pre-tax impairment charges of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020 due to significant adverse economic conditions. The company also faces legal challenges regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. These ongoing legal proceedings and potential reclassification costs could lead to significant additional expenses.

Step 2:
- Decline in Revenue: The company experienced a decrease in revenue, primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on mobility gross bookings, reflecting decreased demand for mobility services.
- Increase in Operating Losses: The net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020, which included significant expenses like stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also showed a loss, particularly in the delivery segment.
- Legal Costs and Impairments: The company incurred costs related to legal proceedings concerning the classification of drivers, as well as impairment charges in previous quarters, indicating financial strain.

Step 3: The financial figures reveal a challenging operational environment for the company, with declining revenues, significant losses, and legal uncertainties adding to its financial pressure. Despite efforts to adapt, such as launching new services during the pandemic, the adverse impact of COVID-19 and ongoing legal battles continue to weigh on the company's financial performance.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The combination of revenue decline, ongoing losses, legal challenges, impairment charges, and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19 indicate a precarious financial situation for the company. The significant expenses and operational losses suggest a high level of financial risk and potential insolvency in the coming periods.
