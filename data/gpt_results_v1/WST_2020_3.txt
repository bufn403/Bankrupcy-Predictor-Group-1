Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears optimistic. They highlight the company's focus on quality, excellence in manufacturing, and their ability to deliver safe products efficiently. They also mention actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation to ensure employee safety and support for customers around the world.

Step 2: The company reported significant increases in consolidated net sales for both the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2020. They specifically attribute the increase to the performance of their Proprietary Products segment, which saw organic growth and benefited from sales related to COVID-19 treatments.

Step 3: The net income also showed improvements for both the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases were largely driven by improvements in operating profit, particularly within the Proprietary Products segment. Additionally, they mentioned strong capital and financial resources with overall liquidity remaining robust.

The positive financial performance and the company's proactive approach during the pandemic contribute to this assessment.
