Step 1: The management’s discussion acknowledges the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain end-markets, although there were improvements in key sectors such as electronics, water filtration, health & wellness, and personal protection. The delayed capital investments in select sectors, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the continuation of the pandemic’s adverse effects, introduce a note of caution into the discussion.

Step 2:
- Sales Volume Variances: The detailed breakdown of net sales by segment and geographic region shows a decline in net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Major regions like Europe, Middle East, and Africa experienced volume declines across all segments, except for Asia Pacific, which saw a 4% increase.
- Cost of Sales Analysis: Cost of sales decreased due to lower sales volume, cost synergies, and certain idling charges. However, the percentage of cost of sales relative to net sales increased in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the previous year.
- R&D Expenses and SG&A Expenses: Research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased, indicating cost reduction measures and improved productivity. However, amortization of intangibles increased significantly, impacting the overall expenses.
- Impairment Charges: The company recognized goodwill and asset impairment charges, restructuring, and asset-related charges related to the Non-Core segment, which suggests underlying financial challenges.
- Integration and Separation Costs: The company incurred lower integration and separation costs, primarily attributed to the timing of distributions.
- Income from Discontinued Operations: The Company had no activity from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2020, limiting potential sources of income.
- Tax Rates: The effective tax rate fluctuated significantly, reaching 460.0% in the third quarter of 2020, mainly due to accounting adjustments and non-deductible expenses.

Step 3: The decline in net sales, coupled with significant impairment charges, restructuring costs, and fluctuating tax rates, indicates financial challenges faced by the company. The reduction in expenses like R&D and SG&A may show some cost-saving measures being implemented. However, the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s operations and financials adds a level of risk.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The financial challenges evidenced by lower net sales, impairment charges, and fluctuating tax rates, alongside uncertainties related to the pandemic's ongoing impact, suggest a medium level of risk of bankruptcy for the company. While cost-saving measures are being implemented, the overall financial health appears compromised by various one-time charges and volume declines.
