Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is pessimistic. The discussion points out significant decreases in total sales and revenues, along with profit per share declines, primarily attributed to lower sales caused by reduced end-user demand across all regions and segments. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations is mentioned as a notable factor affecting the business.

Step 2: 
- The decline in total sales and revenues for both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019, indicate a challenging financial performance.
- Profit per share decrease, including one-time losses like remeasurement losses from pension obligations, further emphasizes the company's financial struggles. 

Step 3: The financial figures presented in the discussion indicate a failed quarter and nine-month period with significant decreases in sales, revenues, and profits. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the situation, resulting in unfavorable financial outcomes for the company. Despite cost-cutting measures and reduced expenses, the overall performance of the company has declined.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The combination of pessimistic sentiment, significant decreases in sales and profits, and the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. The unfavorable financial performance and the challenging market conditions paint a bleak outlook for the company's financial stability in the future.
