Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of cautious optimism and recognition of ongoing challenges. While there have been some positive developments, such as net sales growth in the third quarter, the management acknowledges the uncertainties and potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on their business.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures include a 2.0 percent increase in net sales in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same prior year period, but a 15.7 percent decrease in net sales in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, there was a net loss of $472.6 million in the nine-month period.

Step 3: The company's results have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with disruptions to elective surgical procedures affecting their net sales and leading to cost reduction measures. While there was some improvement in the third quarter, the year-to-date performance shows challenges due to lower sales and impairment charges.

Based on the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mixed performance of net sales, and the ongoing challenges related to the pandemic, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company has taken measures to address liquidity concerns and access to capital, but the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and the continued financial challenges indicate a level of risk that is not low but also not high.
