The following table sets forth net sales and income by reportable segment and on a consolidated basis:
For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company posted record backlog, operating income, operating margins, and operating cash flow, as well as strong orders, sales, net income, and diluted earnings per share.  We achieved these results from organic sales growth in both EIG and EMG, contributions from the acquisitions of Navitar in September 2022 and RTDS in October 2022, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives.  During 2022 and into 2023, we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation in material costs, supply chain constraints, as well as continued uncertainty in the global economy. We expect material cost inflation to remain elevated throughout 2023, but anticipate pricing actions to mitigate this inflationary pressure.  In response to supply chain pressures, we have taken actions to build inventory and seek alternative sources of supply to support sales and backlog growth.  We continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations and will take additional actions as necessary throughout 2023 to mitigate this inflationary pressure.  For 2023, our record backlog, the full year impact of the 2022 acquisitions, the 2023 acquisition of Bison Gear & Engineering Corp., and continued focus on and implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the remainder of our 2023 results.
