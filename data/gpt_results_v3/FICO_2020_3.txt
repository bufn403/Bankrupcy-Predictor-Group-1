- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 2.1508, this ratio demonstrates that a significant portion of the company's assets is funded by retained earnings, indicating financial strength.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to Total Assets ratio of 0.4121 shows that the company is generating a decent level of earnings in relation to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A high value of 0.9608 suggests that the company is efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

These factors indicate a successful quarter and a strong financial position. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company seems to have managed the situation well by focusing on employee health, customer service, and strategic decision-making.

Step 4: Considering the optimistic sentiment in the management discussion, the strong financial ratios, and the successful operational performance highlighted in the text, the company is classified as having a low risk of bankruptcy. The company's focus on revenue growth, cost management, and strategic investments position it well for future financial stability.
