Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and financial performance, the management has implemented various measures to ensure the safety of employees and customers, control expenses, and manage the balance sheet with a focus on liquidity. The company had significant liquidity as of September 30, 2020, and took actions to improve financial flexibility and liquidity throughout the year. However, there are mentions of decreased revenues and the impact of COVID-19 on operations.

Step 2:
- Total Revenues: The total revenues decreased for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, indicating a negative impact on the company's top line due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Equipment Rentals: The revenue from equipment rentals, the company's major revenue source, decreased significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 on operations. Fleet productivity declined, reflecting lower rental volume in response to restrictions.
- Capital Expenditures: The company expected a significant decrease in capital expenditures in 2020, indicating a cautious approach to spending during the pandemic.
  
Step 3: The company demonstrated resilience by taking actions to ensure liquidity and financial flexibility amid the challenges posed by COVID-19. Despite the decrease in revenues and rental activity, the company managed to reduce expenses and improve cash flow. The decrease in equipment rentals and revenues reflects the impact of the pandemic on operations.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company showed proactive measures to address the financial implications of COVID-19, the significant decrease in revenues and rental activities during the pandemic suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy. The cautious approach towards capital expenditures and expense controls indicate a level of financial strain that could elevate the risk, especially if the situation persists without a strong recovery in operations.
