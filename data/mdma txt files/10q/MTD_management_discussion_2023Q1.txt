Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023.Changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.
The following tables set forth items from our interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (amounts in thousands).
Net sales were $928.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $897.8 million for the corresponding period in 2022. This represents an increase in U.S. dollars of 3%. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We experienced broad-based growth in most businesses and regions. We continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques. However, there is uncertainty in the economic environment and our end markets, including the risk of recession in many countries, and market conditions may change quickly. The ongoing developments related to Ukraine and inflation also present several risks to our business as further described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. These topics could adversely impact our financial results and could have a greater impact on our operating results in future periods. Net sales by geographic destination for the three months ended March 31, 2023 in U.S. dollars increased 5% in the Americas and 2% in both Europe and in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased 6% in both the Americas and in Europe, and 10% in Asia/Rest of World, with 9% growth in China, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below.As described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance and spare parts.Net sales of products increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior period. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Net sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The local currency increase in net sales of our laboratory-related products includes strong growth in most product categories offset in part by a significant decline in pipette products primarily related to customer inventory reductions.Net sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 38% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The local currency increase in net sales of our industrial-related products for the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes strong growth in core industrial and product inspection.Net sales in our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 6% of our total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased 32% in U.S. dollars and 36% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in food retailing includes very strong project activity in the Americas and Europe.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 58.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 57.9% for the corresponding period in 2022.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 60.1% and 59.1% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 54.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 53.4% for the corresponding period in 2022.The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily reflects favorable price realization, partially offset by higher costs, business mix and unfavorable foreign currency.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was 4.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 4.8% in the corresponding period during 2022, respectively. Research and development expenses increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 due to increased project activity.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 25.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 26.2% in the corresponding period during 2022, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses was flat in U.S. dollars and increased 2% in local currencies, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The local currency increase includes investments in sales and marketing initiatives offset in part by lower incentive compensation and cost savings.
Amortization expense was $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $16.6 million for the corresponding period in 2022. Interest expense was $18.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $11.3 million for the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in interest expense is related to higher variable interest rates, as well as additional borrowings.Restructuring charges were $4.3 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related costs.Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income and other items. Non-service pension benefits for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Other charges (income), net also included $0.5 million of acquisition costs for the three months ended March 31, 2022.Our reported tax rate was 16.9% and 18.3% during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The provision for taxes is based upon using our projected annual effective tax rate of 18.5% and 19.0% before non-recurring discrete tax items for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The difference between our projected annual effective tax rate and the reported tax rate is related to the timing of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises.
The following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments.  We currently have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations, and Other. A more detailed description of these segments is outlined in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Total net sales and net sales to external customers increased 1% and 4%, respectively for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers for the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes strong growth in most product categories, especially food retailing, partially offset by a significant decline in pipette products.Segment profit increased $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Segment profit during the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives, offset in part by unfavorable business mix.
1)     Represents U.S. dollar growth.Total net sales increased 5% in both U.S. dollars in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Net sales to external customers increased 7% in both U.S. dollars and in local currency during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in local currency net sales to external customers for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 includes particularly strong growth in food retailing and excellent results in industrial, offset in part by a decline in laboratory products, especially pipette products. Segment profit increased $5.1 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Segment profit during the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes benefits from our margin expansion initiatives, offset in part by unfavorable business mix and foreign currency translation.
1)     Represents U.S. dollar growth.Total net sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 7% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Net sales to external customers increased 3% in U.S. dollars and increased 9% in local currencies during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Local currency net sales to external customers for the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes strong growth in most product categories, especially in food retailing, process analytics, and core-industrial, offset in part by a significant decline in pipette products.Segment profit increased $5.7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Segment profit increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives, offset in part by unfavorable business mix and foreign currency translation.
1)     Represents U.S. dollar growth.Total net sales decreased 6% in U.S. dollars and increased 1% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Net sales to external customers by origin increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in local currency net sales to external customers during the three months ended March 31, 2023 reflects very strong growth in laboratory products, with modest growth in industrial products. However, uncertainties exist and market conditions may change quickly. We also will continue to face difficult prior period comparisons in 2023 relating to our strong prior years performance.Segment profit decreased $3.7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The decrease in segment profit for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 primarily relates to unfavorable currency and lower inter-segment sales, offset in part by increased sales to external customers and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives.
1)     Represents U.S. dollar growth.Total net sales and net sales to external customers both increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies during the three month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net sales to external customers includes solid growth in most product categories. Segment profit increased $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in segment profit is primarily related to our margin expansion initiatives and increased sales volume, offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our liquidity needs are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $153.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $90.8 million in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year is primarily related to working capital, especially inventory, and lower cash incentive payments of $20 million. Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $23.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $19.2 million in the corresponding period in 2022. In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. As of March 31, 2023, we have obtained $29.7 million of the $35.8 million of total funding to be received through 2023, which will offset future capital expenditures. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred approximately $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of capital expenditures relating to this funding agreement. We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.Cash flows used in financing activities are primarily comprised of share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent $250.0 million and $275.0 million on the repurchase of 166,628 shares and 190,593 shares, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 with payments expected to commence in 2024, and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income. We expect the financial impact of the IRA to be immaterial to our financial statements.
Our debt consisted of the following at March 31, 2023:
As of March 31, 2023, approximately $595.1 million of additional borrowings was available under our Credit Agreement, and we maintained $89.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flows and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity.  In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31, 2023.In December 2022, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $150 million 10-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.45% (5.45% Senior Notes) in March 2023. The 5.45% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.45% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2033. The terms of the 5.45% Senior Notes are consistent with the previous Senior Notes as described in the Company's Annual Report Form 10-K. We used the proceeds from the sale of the 5.45% Senior Notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $300 million 15-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.81% (2.81% Senior Notes) in March 2022, which will mature in March 2037, and $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.91% (2.91% Senior Notes) in September 2022, which will mature in September 2037. We used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.
In 2018, two of the Company's non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2023.
We have $3.2 billion of remaining availability for our share repurchase program as of March 31, 2023. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors. We have purchased 31.2 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we spent $250.0 million and $275.0 million on the repurchase of 166,628 shares and 190,593 shares at an average price per share of $1,511.78 and $1,442.84, respectively. We reissued 47,849 shares and 27,795 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we incurred $1.9 million of excise tax during the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to the Inflation Reduction Act which is reflected as a reduction in shareholders' equity in our consolidated financial statements.
Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally, and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings decrease. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also decrease. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.9 million to $2.1 million annually.     We also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $3.8 million to $4.3 million annually.     In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at March 31, 2023, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately $35.2 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.
