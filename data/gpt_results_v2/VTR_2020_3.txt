High Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but also highlighting efforts to mitigate its impact.

Step 2: The company's senior living operating portfolio has been affected by the ongoing pandemic, leading to declines in occupancy, elevated operating costs, and modifications of leases with tenants. Additionally, the company has received government financial support to offset some of the losses incurred.

Step 3: While the company has taken steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, the future impact of the pandemic remains highly uncertain, with worsening clinical trends and re-imposed preventative measures in some regions. The company acknowledges the material impact the pandemic could have on its operational and financial performance.

Step 4: The combination of ongoing challenges in the senior living sector, uncertain future impact of the pandemic, and the need for continued financial support indicates a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. Despite efforts to mitigate the effects, the unpredictable nature of the situation and the potential for prolonged financial strain suggest a precarious financial position.
