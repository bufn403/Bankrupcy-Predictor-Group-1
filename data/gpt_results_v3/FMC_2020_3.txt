Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: 
The overall sentiment in the management's discussion seems cautious but optimistic. They address the impact of COVID-19 on their operations but also highlight strong financial performance and proactive measures taken. For example, they mention, "We delivered strong financial performance and navigated the challenges posed by COVID-19 and severe foreign currency headwinds." This indicates a balanced view of the current situation.

Step 2:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.146 indicates a relatively low level of working capital compared to total assets, which may raise concerns about the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.552 signifies a moderate level of retained earnings to total assets, indicating a stable financial position.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.045 suggests a lower return on assets, which may indicate operational inefficiencies.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.376 shows a moderate level of revenue generation relative to total assets.

Step 4:
Based on the analysis of the sentiment in the management's discussion, the financial ratios, and the overall outlook presented in the text, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While they have navigated challenges well and shown strong performance, certain financial ratios indicate areas that need attention to ensure long-term financial stability.
