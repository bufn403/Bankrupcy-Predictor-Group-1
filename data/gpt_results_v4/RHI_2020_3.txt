Step 1: The management's discussion includes forward-looking statements and acknowledges the uncertainties and potential risks associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. While the situation is approached optimistically with a focus on cost management and revenue generation opportunities, the unpredictability of future developments, including the spread of the pandemic and related government actions, presents a significant risk factor.

Step 2: 
- Revenues: The financial results state a decrease in service revenues during the first three quarters of 2020 compared to the prior year, mainly due to the economic crisis driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Gross Margin: The gross margin dollars decreased significantly, primarily attributed to lower conversion revenues and staff utilization rates, impacting different segments like temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting services.

Step 3: The financial performance of the company has been negatively impacted by the economic crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, evident in the reduction in service revenues and gross margin dollars across various segments. The decrease in revenues and gross margin reflects the challenges faced by the company due to the pandemic-induced economic disruptions.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The significant decrease in revenues and gross margin, driven by the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations, indicates a level of financial strain. While the measures to manage costs and seek revenue opportunities show proactive efforts, the ongoing uncertainties in the global economic environment due to the pandemic pose a considerable risk to the company's financial stability in the near term.
