Step 1: The management's discussion contains a mix of sentiments, including cautious optimism about taking measures to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic but also indicating significant adverse effects on the hospitality industry, including reduced travel. The discussion recognizes the challenges faced by the company due to the pandemic and highlights efforts to prioritize safety and security by launching initiatives like Hilton CleanStay and Hilton EventReady.

Step 2:
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) witnessed a significant decrease due to reduced occupancy and average daily rates during the pandemic.
- Net income was adversely impacted by suspensions of hotel operations, resulting in decreased hotel revenues.
- EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were affected by reductions in revenues across managed, franchised, owned, and leased hotels.

Step 3: The COVID-19 pandemic has visibly impacted the company's financial performance, as seen through the significant declines in RevPAR and profits from operations. The discussions on decreased revenues, suspended hotel operations, and efforts to support safety indicate ongoing challenges in the hospitality industry. While the company has undertaken measures to mitigate risks, such as temporary closures and cost reduction strategies, the continued uncertainty and adverse effects suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite the company's efforts to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through cleanliness initiatives and cost reductions, the significant declines in RevPAR and earnings, as well as the uncertainty surrounding global travel restrictions, point to a medium risk of bankruptcy. The ongoing challenges in the hospitality industry and the company's reliance on travel demand underscore the uncertainties that could continue to affect its financial stability in the future.
