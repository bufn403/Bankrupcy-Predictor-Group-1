Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is seen in statements such as "the spread of epidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks and specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), which are expected to continue to adversely impact our results..." This cautious tone indicates awareness of ongoing risks.

Step 2: The discussion mentions the implementation of health and safety protocols, efforts to reduce operating expenses, and the potential need for additional financing. For example, "our potential future need for additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders." These indicate financial challenges and uncertainties about future cash flows.

Step 3: The filing highlights the substantial impairment losses recognized for goodwill and trade names during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, due to the continued spread of COVID-19 and the voluntary suspension of cruise voyages. The uncertainty surrounding the resumption of operations and the prolonged suspension of cruises suggest financial strain and potential long-term impacts on the company's financial health.

Based on the overall cautious sentiment, financial challenges, and significant impairment losses, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy in the future.
