Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is pessimistic due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business. They mention reductions in revenue, cost-cutting measures including workforce reductions and asset impairments, and the expectation of continued adverse effects on revenue and operations. One quote supporting this sentiment is: "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our business and results of operations... revenue decreased $1,398.4 million, or 12.9%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Step 2: Relevant figures provided in the discussion show significant decreases in revenue, with a 12.9% drop compared to the previous year. The company also took actions to align their cost structure by reducing workforce and facilities, recording a pre-tax charge of $277.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, salary and service costs were reduced by $68.7 million and $117.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively.

Step 3: The figures provided indicate a failed quarter, with revenue decreasing across all principal regional markets, negative organic growth, and a decline in operating profit for the nine months of 2020. The company acknowledges that the decline in revenue will likely continue through the fourth quarter of 2020 and that their efforts to mitigate the impact of economic conditions may not be fully effective. One quote supporting this is: "the decrease in revenue across our principal regional markets were: North America decreased $688.1 million, Europe decreased $404.1 million, Asia-Pacific decreased $143.7 million and Latin America decreased $98.2 million."

Based on the pessimistic sentiment, the significant decrease in revenue, failed quarter results, and uncertain outlook for improvement, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy.
