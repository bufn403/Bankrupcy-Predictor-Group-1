Step 1: The management discussion in the 10-Q filing contains a blend of cautiously optimistic and cautionary language, pointing out the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial condition and operations. The forward-looking statements outline various uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and its potential effects on the company and its tenants.

Step 2:
- Financial Performance Impact: The company mentions the closure of tenants' operations due to COVID-19 restrictions, which could affect their ability to pay rent and meet lease obligations.
- Debt Service Requirements: The discussion points out significant debt service requirements that may limit the company's ability to pursue business and growth strategies.
- Economic Conditions: The uncertain economic conditions, including low consumer confidence and employment levels, are highlighted, which could impact the gaming industry and the company's tenants.

Step 3: Given the potential risks associated with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's tenants' ability to meet lease obligations, coupled with the significant debt service requirements and the broader economic uncertainties mentioned, the company appears to be in a medium-risk category for potential financial distress. While the company has demonstrated resilience and is actively monitoring the situation, the uncertainties and risks outlined in the filing indicate a level of vulnerability.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The numerous risk factors related to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainties surrounding economic conditions, and the company's debt obligations suggest a level of financial risk that falls between low and high. The company's ability to navigate these challenges, particularly regarding its tenants' financial performance and operational restrictions, will be critical in determining its future financial stability.
