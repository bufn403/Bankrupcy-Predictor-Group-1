Decision: Medium

Step 1: The management discussion text provides insights into the company's financial performance, including net income data and various special items impacting the results. The tone appears cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on operations and increased expenses. The mention of adverse effects on business due to the pandemic indicates a level of uncertainty.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.1095 - This ratio suggests that the company may have limited working capital to cover its short-term obligations relative to its total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.5699 - A higher proportion of retained earnings to total assets indicates financial stability and profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0145 - This ratio suggests that the company's earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of total assets are relatively low.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.5239 - A high ratio of total revenue to total assets implies efficient asset utilization to generate revenue.

Step 3: Combining the financial ratios and text analysis, the company shows mixed signals. While the high Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio indicates financial strength, the low EBIT to Total Assets ratio and cautious tone in the management discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 suggest challenges. The company's ability to manage expenses during the pandemic will be critical for its financial health.

Step 4: Considering the cautious tone in the management discussion, along with the relatively low EBIT to Total Assets ratio, the company is classified as having a Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company faces challenges due to the ongoing pandemic and its impact on operations and expenses, despite some indicators of financial stability like the Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio. Vigilance in cost management and adaptation to changing business conditions will be essential to mitigate the risk.
