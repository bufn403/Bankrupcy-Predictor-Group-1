Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While the text acknowledges challenges such as the impact of COVID-19 on operations and lower commodity prices, it also highlights strategic moves to navigate these difficulties, such as portfolio flexibility, maintaining liquidity, and cost reduction efforts. 

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets indicates potential financial distress as the company may have more short-term liabilities than short-term assets to cover them.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A relatively high value of retained earnings to total assets (0.61) signifies stability as it shows a significant portion of assets are financed by internal equity.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): Earnings before interest and taxes to total assets ratio (0.115) is relatively low, indicating that the company's assets may not be generating substantial earnings.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A total revenue to total assets ratio of 0.33 suggests that the company generates a moderate level of revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment analysis with the financial ratios, the company appears to be facing challenges due to the lower commodity prices and operational disruptions caused by COVID-19. While the company has taken steps to manage its costs, maintain liquidity, and adjust its capital budget, the negative working capital to total assets ratio and lower EBIT to Total Assets ratio indicate financial strain. The high Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides a buffer, but the overall financial performance seems mixed.

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mix of financial ratios, and the current economic conditions impacting the company's industry, the assessment leans towards a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company has strategic initiatives in place to mitigate risks, but the financial indicators suggest a challenging financial situation that warrants careful monitoring.
