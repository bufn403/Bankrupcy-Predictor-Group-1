Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and highlights the challenges faced by the company due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although they have taken steps to protect their business, uncertainties remain, as stated, "The uncertainties in the global economy may also impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and service providers...", indicating a sense of concern.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0759 - This ratio indicates that the company has a lower working capital relative to its total assets, which may suggest a potential liquidity issue.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.2051 - The proportion of retained earnings to total assets is moderate, indicating stability in the company's earnings retention.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1665 - The EBIT to Total Assets ratio suggests that the company is generating a moderate level of earnings relative to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.7615 - The high Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio indicates that the company is efficient in generating revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the cautionary tone in the management's discussion with the financial ratios, it appears that while the company is generating revenue efficiently (X5), there are concerns about working capital (X1) and the impact of the pandemic on operations. The EBIT to Total Assets ratio (X3) being at a moderate level indicates that profitability is not severely impacted, but the challenges mentioned in the management discussion pose risks to sustained earnings.

Step 4: Medium risk - The company exhibits a mix of financial stability and risks, with a cautious outlook due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential challenges in liquidity. The financial ratios provide a nuanced view of the company's current position, warranting a medium-risk classification.
