Step 1: The tone of the management's discussion is cautious and reveals significant challenges the company is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is uncertainty regarding the resumption of cruise operations, as highlighted by statements such as "These global efforts have resulted in travel restrictions and created significant uncertainty," and "Continued disruptions to travel and port operations in various regions may result in further suspensions."

Step 2: The company reported impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets during the periods ended March 31, 2020, and June 30, 2020. For example, regarding Silversea Cruises, the filing states, "As a result of this analysis, we determined that the carrying value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its fair value," which led to significant impairment charges.

Step 3: Despite certain improvement in the fair value of assets like Royal Caribbean International's goodwill exceeding its carrying value by 30% as of March 31, 2020, there are ongoing challenges. The filing mentions updated impairment evaluations for other long-lived assets in June 2020 due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on expected cash flows.

Step 4: Considering the cautious tone, impairment charges, and ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic's effects on operations and financial metrics, the company's risk of bankruptcy is medium. The impairment charges and uncertainties surrounding the resumption of cruise operations indicate financial strain and operational challenges ahead, placing the company at moderate risk of bankruptcy.
