Decision: Medium

Step 1: The management discussion text provides both optimistic and pessimistic perspectives. The company acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and the uncertainty surrounding future developments. However, it also expresses confidence in its strategy and long-term contingency planning. The tone is cautious but somewhat optimistic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio is relatively low at 0.0242, indicating the company may have limited short-term financial resources to cover its obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The ratio is at 0.2122, suggesting that a significant portion of the company's assets are financed through retained earnings, which is a positive sign for financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): With a ratio of 0.0794, the company's profitability in relation to its total assets is moderate.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.2522 shows that the company generates a decent amount of revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment analysis of the text with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as mentioned in the management discussion. The low working capital ratio indicates some short-term liquidity risk, while the moderate profitability suggests the company is able to generate income from its assets. The reliance on retained earnings for financing is a positive sign but may also signal limitations in accessing external funding if needed.

Step 4: Overall, considering the mixed sentiment in the management discussion, the financial ratios pointing towards some financial strain, and the cautious outlook presented by the company, the assessment leans towards medium risk of bankruptcy. The company shows signs of resilience but also faces uncertainties and financial constraints that could pose challenges in the future.
