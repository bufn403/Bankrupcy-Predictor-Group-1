Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious but optimistic. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but also highlights efforts to mitigate risks and continue operations. The tone is reflected in statements such as, "The\xa0COVID-19\xa0pandemic continues to be dynamic and near-term challenges across the economy remain" and "Looking forward, our top priority has been and will always be the health and safety of our employees, customers and community..." This indicates a level of awareness and proactive response to the current situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The value of 0.2399888506921862 suggests that the company has a moderate ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.0726563225866394, the company's retained earnings are at a relatively low level compared to its total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The value of 0.1332342283749883 indicates that the company's earnings before interest and taxes relative to its total assets are at a moderate level.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): This ratio at 0.6348601690978352 implies that the company generates a significant amount of revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: The financial ratios suggest a mixed financial health picture. While the company generates a considerable amount of revenue in proportion to its assets (X5), the low values of retained earnings to total assets (X2) and working capital to total assets (X1) raise concerns about liquidity and long-term financial stability. The EBIT to Total Assets ratio (X3) indicates a moderate profitability level. The company seems to be managing operations and profitability, but liquidity and retained earnings could be areas of improvement.

Step 4: Considering the cautious but optimistic tone of the management's discussion, along with the mix of financial ratios indicating challenges in liquidity and retained earnings, the company falls into the medium risk category. While the company is handling the current situation adequately, there are areas that require attention to enhance financial stability and reduce the risk of potential bankruptcy.
