Step 1: The management discussion section of the 10-Q filing shows a comprehensive overview of the company's operations, challenges, and future plans. The sentiment appears to be cautious and practical, focusing on managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring continuity of operations.

Step 2: The filing mentions the impact of COVID-19 on the company, particularly in terms of increased operation and maintenance expenses due to health and safety-related costs. Additionally, there are fluctuations in sales patterns with higher residential sales but lower commercial and industrial sales. Financial projections indicate potential impacts on net income based on variations in sales.

Step 3: The discussion highlights the challenges faced during the pandemic, such as the inability to utilize commercial paper initially and the subsequent need to draw on revolving credit facilities. Despite cost management efforts and identified cost savings, there are potential negative impacts on operating results due to the pandemic-related expenses and changes in sales patterns.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment of the management discussion, the financial impacts of the pandemic on operations, and the uncertainties regarding future sales patterns and customer behaviors, the company is assessed as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The proactive measures taken, such as cost-saving initiatives and addressing customer needs, demonstrate resilience but the ongoing challenges from the pandemic present risks that need to be carefully managed.
