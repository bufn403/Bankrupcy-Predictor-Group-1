Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While there is a focus on navigating the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the strategies implemented to adapt to the changing consumer landscape, there are uncertainties expressed regarding the potential adverse impacts of the pandemic on future revenue growth and profitability. For example, "there remains the risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability" suggests a level of caution regarding future performance.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.425 indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital to support its total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.036 is relatively low, suggesting a lower proportion of retained earnings in relation to total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.158 shows a moderate level of earnings before interest and taxes in relation to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.365 indicates a high level of total revenue generated in relation to total assets.

Step 3: Considering the financial ratios alongside the text analysis, the company appears to be facing challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, as indicated by the uncertainties expressed and the need to adapt its strategies. While the total revenue to total assets ratio is high, potentially reflecting strong performance, the lower retained earnings to total assets ratio and mixed sentiment in the management discussion suggest some financial strain and uncertainty about future profitability.

Step 4: Based on the mixed sentiment in the management discussion, coupled with the financial ratios indicating moderate working capital, lower retained earnings in proportion to total assets, and moderate earnings to total assets, the company is classified as having a Medium Risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the pandemic and the need for ongoing strategic adaptations contribute to this assessment.
