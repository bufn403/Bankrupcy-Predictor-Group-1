This suggests that the company is facing significant impacts on its operations.

- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio of 0.138 indicates that the company may have limited working capital to cover its short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a ratio of 0.334, the company has a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to its total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to Total Assets ratio of 0.066 suggests that the company's earnings before interest and taxes are relatively low compared to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.343 implies that the company is generating revenue, but it may not be efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sufficient income.

The financial ratios indicate a mixed picture with limited working capital, moderate retained earnings, low EBIT, and moderate revenue generation efficiency. This suggests that the company is not in a strong financial position and may be at medium risk of facing bankruptcy in the future.
