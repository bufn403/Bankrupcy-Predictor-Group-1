Step 1: The management's discussion provides a detailed overview of Cintas's operations, focusing on providing a wide range of products and services to enhance customer experience and safety. While there are mentions of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an emphasis on the company's ability to adapt to the changing business environment and implement health and safety measures to ensure business continuity.

Step 2: The financial statements indicate a decrease in total revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic business closures. For instance, "Total revenue decreased 4.7% for the three months ended November 30, 2020, over the same period in the prior fiscal year, from $1,843.7 million to $1,757.0 million as a result of decreased sales volume from the COVID-19 pandemic business closures."

Step 3: Despite the revenue decrease attributed to the pandemic, the company has demonstrated cost control measures, such as reducing labor and energy costs, which positively impacted the operating income. The management mentions putting in health and safety measures, increasing inventory based on customer demand, and focusing on business continuity in response to COVID-19 disruptions.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. While the revenue decline due to the pandemic is a concern, the company's ability to manage costs, maintain profitability, adapt to changing circumstances, and ensure business continuity through health and safety measures suggests a stable financial position. Additionally, the proactive approach in serving customers and addressing challenges indicates a lower risk of bankruptcy in the near term.
