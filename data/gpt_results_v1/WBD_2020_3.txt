Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion appears to be cautious and realistic due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. This sentiment is reflected in the statement: "Demand for our advertising products and services has been reduced by the pandemic due to economic disruptions...Our advertising revenues...have declined during 2020 and may continue to decline significantly throughout the remainder of 2020..." This indicates a challenging environment for the company.

Step 2: The company experienced a decline in advertising revenue of 8% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, distribution revenue fluctuated but remained relatively flat, with decreases in certain international markets offset by increases in the U.S. These figures suggest a mixed financial performance during the pandemic.

Step 3: The costs of revenues increased by 10% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to the impact from the timing of sporting events. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased, showing some cost-saving efforts. However, the company also recorded restructuring charges during this period, indicating ongoing adjustments to adapt to the pandemic-induced challenges.

Based on the cautious sentiment, declines in key revenue streams, mixed financial performance, and ongoing cost-saving efforts and restructuring actions, the company presents a medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainty surrounding the financial impacts of the pandemic and the need for operational adjustments contribute to this assessment.
