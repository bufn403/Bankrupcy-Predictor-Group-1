Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion section appears cautious and realistic rather than overly optimistic. This is evident from statements such as "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, making the broader implications on our future results of operations and overall financial performance uncertain at this time" and "There can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our dividend payments without the benefit of other sources of capital or changes to our current dividend policy."

Step 2: The discussion mentions a decline in pro-rata same property NOI, new leasing activity, and a decrease in occupancy due to bankruptcies and COVID-19 related move-outs. For example, "Our pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, declined 11.9%" and "The decrease in occupancy is primarily driven by bankruptcies and other COVID-19 related tenant move-outs."

Step 3: The company acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, mentioning that many retailers have had to close or seek rent concessions. Additionally, there are delays in construction, sourcing materials, and labor shortages affecting their projects. The uncertainty regarding future cash flows and the need for capital to fund dividend payments indicate financial strain.

Step 4: Taking into consideration the cautious sentiment, the decline in key financial metrics, and the challenges posed by the pandemic on the company's operations and cash flow, the overall assessment points to a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company is facing significant uncertainties and financial pressures which may impact its ability to meet financial obligations in the future.
