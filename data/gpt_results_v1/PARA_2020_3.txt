Step 1: The management's discussion includes a section about the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ViacomCBS. While there are mentions of some positive aspects such as increases in subscribers for streaming services, the overall tone is cautious and acknowledges the significant challenges faced by the company. This suggests a certain level of pessimism regarding the current situation.

Step 2: ViacomCBS reported a 9% decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by the adverse effects of COVID-19, lower demand in the advertising market, closure of movie theaters, and production shutdowns. Operating income decreased by 7% for the same period. Additionally, net earnings and diluted EPS from continuing operations each decreased by 2%. These figures indicate financial struggles and a decline in profitability.

Step 3: Looking at the future outlook, the management mentions that they expect the negative impact from COVID-19 to continue for the remainder of the year. However, they do foresee further improvement in the fourth quarter. Factors like uncertainties regarding the return of advertising revenues to historical levels and the reopening of movie theaters pose risks to the company's recovery.

Based on the cautious sentiment, the decreased financial performance for the quarter, and the uncertain future outlook, ViacomCBS is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The challenges highlighted in the filing, especially those related to the ongoing pandemic and its impact on various revenue streams, indicate a precarious financial situation that warrants concern.
