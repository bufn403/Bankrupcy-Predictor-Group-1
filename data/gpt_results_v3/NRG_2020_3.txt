Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems cautiously optimistic. While the company faced challenges due to COVID-19, they have implemented measures to ensure business continuity. A key quote supporting this is: "As a result of these business continuity measures, the Company has not experienced any material disruptions in its ability to continue its business operations to date."

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) is very low at 0.0087, indicating potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) is also relatively low at 0.0314, suggesting a modest level of earnings retention.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) is 0.0174, indicating a moderate level of earnings generated relative to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) is high at 1.107, suggesting that the company generates substantial revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the text analysis with the financial ratios, it appears that while the company has managed to maintain operations during the pandemic, their financial ratios indicate some challenges, especially in terms of working capital and retained earnings. The high revenue to total assets ratio shows the company's revenue generation capability, but the low working capital ratio raises concerns about liquidity.

Step 4: Considering all factors, including the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mixed financial ratios, and the challenging external environment due to the pandemic, it leads to a classification of medium risk of bankruptcy for the company. There are strengths such as revenue generation but weaknesses in working capital and earnings retention that point to potential financial struggles in the future.
