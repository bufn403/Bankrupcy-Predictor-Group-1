Step 1: The management's discussion provides a detailed overview of the company's structure, history, and recent significant events such as the Chapter 11 filings by subsidiaries, organizational model changes, and the completion of the Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The discussion also emphasizes the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and outlines the cost-cutting measures and adjustments made to mitigate these impacts.

Step 2: 
- Net Revenues: The net revenues increased by 0.7% and 1.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The increase primarily stemmed from improved pricing, favorable currency exchange movements, and cost containment initiatives.
- Gross Profit Margin: The gross profit margin increased by 70 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by improved pricing and cost containment initiatives despite unfavorable product mix and under-absorption of fixed production overhead costs.
- Selling and Administrative Expenses: These expenses remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and decreased by 1.3%, or $23.0 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to cost containment actions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Step 3: While the company experienced some positive results such as increased net revenues and improved profit margins driven by pricing strategies and cost containment initiatives, there were challenges attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting volumes, supply chain, and foreign currency exchange rates. The company's proactive measures in response to the pandemic, like cost-cutting actions and operational adjustments, indicate efforts to navigate through the crisis.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's operations have been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower volumes, supply chain disruptions, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange movements. While the company has taken proactive steps to mitigate these impacts and continues to focus on operational effectiveness, the uncertainties surrounding the global economic conditions, as well as the effects of the pandemic on its liquidity and financial position, pose a moderate risk of bankruptcy in the current environment.
