1. **Step 1:**
   - The overall sentiment in the management's discussion section is cautious and pessimistic. The company acknowledges the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential long-term impacts on their business. They mention reduced client demand, project deferrals, furloughs, and temporary rate concessions adversely affecting revenues. This is evident in the statement: "we are experiencing reduced client demand... project deferrals, furloughs, and temporary rate concessions to continue to adversely affect revenues across all business segments" and "As clients work through significant financial challenges... we have faced and may continue to face reduced client demand... and insolvency risk."

2. **Step 2:**
   - The company reports a decrease in revenues from certain segments due to the pandemic, such as retail, consumer goods, travel, and hospitality clients. At the same time, there's a negative impact on revenues from technology clients due to strategic decisions made in 2019, which are expected to affect revenues in 2020. The statement "Retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality clients were particularly adversely affected by the pandemic... negatively impacted by approximately $57 million due to our 2019 strategic decision" reflects this trend.

3. **Step 3:**
   - The company's operating margin and adjusted operating margin decreased compared to the previous year, attributed to higher compensation costs, the impact of recent acquisitions, and cost-cutting measures. The business segments saw reductions in travel and entertainment expenses, but these savings were offset by various costs including those related to COVID-19. The statement "Our operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin decreased... were adversely impacted by higher incentive-based compensation... offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic" highlights this aspect.

Based on the cautious sentiment, decreased revenues in key segments, and decreased operating margins, the company shows signs of high risk of bankruptcy. The challenges posed by the pandemic and the expected impact on future revenues and operations raise concerns about the company's financial stability.
