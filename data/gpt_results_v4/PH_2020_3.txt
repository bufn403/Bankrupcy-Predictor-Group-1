Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious and realistic, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the company's operations. There is clear acknowledgment of the negative effects of the pandemic on the business and results of operations, with an emphasis on safety measures, cost-cutting strategies, and workforce management.

Step 2:
- Net Sales: The net sales for the current-year quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 decreased slightly compared to the comparable prior-year periods due to lower volume in various segments, partially offset by acquisitions and favorable currency rate changes.
- Gross Profit Margin: The gross profit margin increased primarily due to higher margins in specific business segments and the absence of certain expenses related to prior years.
- Operating Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending and wage expenses stemming from pandemic responses.
- Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate was higher than prior periods due to a decrease in discrete tax benefits, but the fiscal 2021 overall effective tax rate is expected to be around 23 percent.

Step 3: Despite the challenges faced, the company has taken proactive measures to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations, including cost reductions, workforce management, and safety protocols. The slight decrease in net sales was managed through strategic actions, and the improvement in gross profit margin indicates operational efficiency.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. The company's cautious approach to managing costs, maintaining a stable investment-grade credit profile, and prioritizing capital expenditures for safety and strategic investments demonstrate sound financial stewardship. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and take necessary actions to enhance operational efficiency suggests a low risk of bankruptcy in the near future.
