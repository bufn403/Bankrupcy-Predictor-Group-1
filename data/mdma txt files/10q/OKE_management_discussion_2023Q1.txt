Please refer to the “Financial Results and Operating Information” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report for additional information.Market Conditions and Business Update - We experienced increased volumes in the second quarter 2023, compared with the second quarter 2022, due primarily to increased producer activity in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, highlighting our extensive and integrated assets that are located in, and connected to, some of the most productive shale basins in the United States.  Although the energy industry has experienced many commodity cycles, we have positioned ourselves to reduce exposure to direct commodity price volatility.  Each of our three reportable segments are primarily fee-based, and we expect our consolidated earnings to be approximately 90% fee-based in 2023.  While our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s earnings are primarily fee-based, we have direct commodity price exposure related primarily to fee with POP contracts, and we have hedged approximately 70% of our forecasted equity volumes for the remainder of 2023.  In addition, our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments are exposed to volumetric risk as a result of drilling and completion activity, severe weather disruptions, operational outages, global crude oil, NGL and natural gas demand, changes in gas-to-oil ratios and normal volumetric well declines.  Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment is not exposed to significant volumetric risk due to nearly all of our capacity being subscribed under long-term, firm fee-based contracts.Merger Transaction - On May 14, 2023, we announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common units of Magellan in a cash-and-stock transaction.  Magellan primarily transports, stores and distributes refined petroleum products and crude oil.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each common unit of Magellan will be exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.667 shares of ONEOK common stock and $25.00 of cash, in a taxable transaction to Magellan unitholders.  ONEOK, ONEOK Partners and the Intermediate Partnership expect to issue guarantees of Magellan’s debt, which we expect to remain outstanding.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $18 million of Merger Transaction related costs, of which $9 million relates to bridge facility commitment fees included in interest expense, and $9 million is included in operations and maintenance in our Consolidated Statement of Income.Our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of the general partner of Magellan both unanimously approved the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2023, subject to the approval of both ONEOK shareholders and Magellan unitholders and other customary closing conditions.  In June 2023, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 expired, which satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the Merger Transaction.  See Part 2, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks related to the Merger Transaction.
Medford Incident - On July 9, 2022, a fire occurred at our 210 MBbl/d Medford, Oklahoma, natural gas liquids fractionation facility.  On January 9, 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the Medford incident.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022.  The remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter 2023, resulting in a one-time settlement gain of $779 million.  The proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims. In the first half of 2023, the Medford incident resulted in an increase in operating income and adjusted EBITDA of $702 million, compared with the same period in the prior year, due to the settlement gain of $779 million, which was offset partially by $77 million of third-party fractionation costs.  We expect our cash from operations in the remainder of 2023 and in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs resulting from the Medford incident for which we no longer receive business interruption proceeds.  Due to market demand and a more favorable completion schedule, we announced plans to construct a new 125 MBbl/d MB-6 NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas, instead of rebuilding our Medford NGL fractionator at this time.  The MB-6 fractionator will produce purity ethane instead of the ethane/propane mix previously produced at the Medford facility.  The 125 MBbl/d capacity of the MB-6 fractionator is expected to be economically comparable to the capacity lost at Medford.  In addition, our 125 MBbl/d MB-5 NGL fractionator was completed in April 2023, which has reduced the need for third-party fractionation while the new MB-6 fractionator is being constructed.Sustainability and Social Responsibility - Through our participation in the 2022 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, we qualified for inclusion in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook for the third consecutive year, ranking in the top 10% of the Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation industry and being recognized as an Industry Mover.  We continue to look for ways to reduce our GHG emissions and utilize more efficient technologies.  We are evaluating the development of renewable energy and low-carbon projects, including opportunities that may complement our midstream assets and expertise.Natural Gas - In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, processed volumes increased in the second quarter 2023, compared with the second quarter 2022, due primarily to increased producer activity in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, as a result of recently completed expansion projects, we fully subscribed an additional 4 Bcf of our existing storage capacity in Oklahoma through 2027, with 90% subscribed through 2029.  In addition, we are nearing completion of the electrification of certain compression assets on Viking to improve the reliability of our operations while lowering our Scope 1 emissions from this equipment.  Viking is seeking to recover its investment in the project through a proposed increase in rates filed in July 2023. NGLs - In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we benefited from increased volumes in the second quarter 2023, compared with the second quarter 2022, due primarily to increased production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain region. Ethane Economics - Price differentials between ethane and natural gas can cause natural gas processors to recover ethane or leave it in the natural gas stream, known as ethane rejection.  As a result of these ethane economics, ethane volumes on our system can fluctuate.  Ethane volumes under long-term contracts delivered to our NGL system increased approximately 10 MBbl/d to an average of 490 MBbl/d in the second quarter 2023, compared with an average of 480 MBbl/d in the second quarter 2022, due primarily to changes in ethane extraction economics.  We estimate that there are approximately 250 MBbl/d of discretionary ethane, consisting of approximately 150 MBbl/d in the Rocky Mountain region and approximately 100 MBbl/d in the Mid-Continent region, that could be recovered and transported on our system.Capital Projects - We operate an integrated, reliable and diversified network of NGL and natural gas gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation and storage assets connecting supply in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Permian regions with key market centers.  Our primary capital projects are outlined in the table below:
(a) - Excludes capitalized interest/AFUDC.Debt Repayments - In June 2023, we redeemed our $500 million, 7.5% senior notes due September 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.In February 2023, we redeemed our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due September 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.Dividends - In February and May 2023, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.955 per share ($3.82 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 2% compared with the same quarters in the prior year.  Our dividend growth is due primarily to the increase in cash flows resulting from the growth of our operations.  We declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.955 per share ($3.82 per share on an annualized basis) in July 2023.  The quarterly common stock dividend will be paid August 14, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 1, 2023.
Management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance.  Our consolidated financial metrics include: (1) operating income; (2) net income; (3) diluted EPS; and (4) adjusted EBITDA.  We evaluate segment operating results using adjusted EBITDA and our operating metrics, which include various volume and rate statistics that are relevant for the respective segment.  These operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of volumes and rate/price.  Management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results.  For additional information on our operating metrics, see the respective segment subsections of this “Financial Results and Operating Information” section.Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, allowance for equity funds used during construction, noncash compensation expense and certain other noncash items.  We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, EPS or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.
Selected Financial Results - The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated:
See reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.Changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.Operating income increased $48 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following: •Natural Gas Liquids - an increase of $64 million in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, offset partially by $31 million of third-party fractionation costs resulting from the Medford incident and $15 million in lower optimization and marketing earnings;•Natural Gas Gathering and Processing - an increase of $66 million from higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions; and •Natural Gas Pipelines - an increase of $16 million in transportation and storage services due primarily to higher firm and interruptible transportation volumes and higher storage park and loan activity; offset by•Consolidated Operating Costs - an increase of $66 million due primarily to higher employee-related costs, outside services, property insurance and costs related to the Merger Transaction.Operating income increased $883 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following: •Natural Gas Liquids - an increase of $702 million related to the Medford incident, due to the settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $77 million of third-party fractionation costs, and an increase of $93 million in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin;•Natural Gas Gathering and Processing - an increase of $97 million from higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions and an increase of $65 million due primarily to higher average fee rates; and •Natural Gas Pipelines - an increase of $38 million in transportation and storage services due primarily to higher storage rates, higher firm and interruptible transportation volumes and higher storage park and loan activity; offset by•Consolidated Operating Costs - an increase of $98 million due primarily to higher employee-related costs, outside services, property insurance and costs related to the Merger Transaction.Net income and diluted EPS increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to the items discussed above, benefits related to the mark-to-market of investments associated with certain benefit plan investments, higher interest income due to both higher cash balances and higher interest rates and higher equity in net earnings from investments.  These increases were offset partially by Merger Transaction costs included in interest expense related to bridge facility commitment fees.Capital expenditures increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to our growth projects.Additional information regarding our financial results and operating information is provided in the following discussion for each of our segments.
Overview - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides midstream services to producers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma.  Raw natural gas is typically gathered at the wellhead, compressed and transported through pipelines to our processing facilities.  Most raw natural gas produced at the wellhead also contains a mixture of NGL components, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  Processed natural gas, usually referred to as residue natural gas, is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines, storage facilities and end users.  The NGLs separated from the raw natural gas are sold and delivered through NGL pipelines to fractionation facilities for further processing.Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s earnings are primarily fee-based, but we have some direct commodity price exposure related primarily to fee with POP contracts.  Under certain fee with POP contracts, our contractual fees and POP percentage may increase or decrease if production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices change relative to specified thresholds.  To mitigate the impact of this commodity price exposure, we have hedged a significant portion of our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s commodity price risk for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.  This segment has substantial long-term acreage dedications in some of the most productive areas of the Williston Basin, which helps to mitigate long-term volumetric risk.Capital Projects - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment has invested in growth projects in NGL-rich areas in the Williston Basin.  See “Capital Projects” in the “Recent Developments” section for more information on our capital projects.For a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.Selected Financial Results and Operating Information - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated:
See reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.Changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $62 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $66 million from higher volumes due primarily to increased producer activity in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions and the impact of severe weather in the Rocky Mountain region in the second quarter 2022; and•an increase of $16 million due primarily to higher average fee rates, offset partially by lower realized NGL prices, net of hedging; offset by•an increase of $16 million in operating costs due primarily to higher materials and supplies expense due primarily to the growth of our operations and higher employee-related costs.Adjusted EBITDA increased $130 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $97 million from higher volumes due primarily to increased producer activity in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, and the impact of severe weather in the Rocky Mountain region in the second quarter 2022; and•an increase of $65 million due primarily to higher average fee rates, offset partially by lower realized NGL prices, net of hedging; offset by•an increase of $28 million in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs and materials and supplies expense due primarily to the growth of our operations.Capital expenditures decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to our Demicks Lake III project completed in the first quarter 2023.
(a) - Includes volumes for consolidated entities only.(b) - Includes volumes we processed at company-owned and third-party facilities.Our natural gas processed volumes increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to increased producer activity in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, and the impact of severe weather in the Rocky Mountain region in the second quarter 2022. Our average fee rate increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to inflation-based escalators in our contracts, and for certain fee with POP contracts, our contractual fees increased due to production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices relative to specified contractual thresholds.
Overview - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment owns and operates facilities that gather, fractionate, treat and distribute NGLs and store purity NGLs, primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and the Rocky Mountain region, which includes the Williston, Powder River and DJ Basins.  We provide midstream services to producers of NGLs and deliver those products to the two primary market centers: one in the Mid-Continent in Conway, Kansas, and the other in the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  We own or have an ownership interest in FERC-regulated NGL gathering and distribution pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado, and terminal and storage facilities in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois.  We have a 50% ownership interest in Overland Pass, which operates an interstate NGL pipeline originating in Wyoming and Colorado and terminating in Kansas.  The majority of the pipeline-connected natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle are connected to our NGL gathering systems.  We lease rail cars and own and operate truck- and rail-loading and -unloading facilities connected to our NGL fractionation, storage and pipeline assets.  We also own FERC-regulated NGL distribution pipelines in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana that connect our Mid-Continent assets with Midwest markets, including Chicago, Illinois.  A portion of our ONEOK North System transports refined petroleum products, including unleaded gasoline and diesel, from Kansas to Iowa.Capital Projects - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment invests in growth projects to transport, fractionate, store and deliver to market centers NGL supply from shale and other resource development areas.  Our growth strategy is focused around connecting diversified supply basins from the Rocky Mountain region through the Mid-Continent region and the Permian Basin with demand for purity NGLs from the petrochemical and refining industries and NGL exports in the Gulf Coast.  We proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into supply agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth. See “Capital Projects” in the “Recent Developments” section for more information on our capital projects.In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we connected one third-party natural gas processing plant in the Permian Basin and one affiliate natural gas processing plant in the Rocky Mountain region. For a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.Selected Financial Results and Operating Information - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Natural Gas Liquids segment for the periods indicated:
See reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section. Changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $64 million in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin; offset by•an increase of $31 million in third-party fractionation costs resulting from the Medford incident, which partially offsets the settlement gain recognized in the first quarter 2023; •a decrease of $15 million in optimization and marketing due primarily to lower earnings on sales of purity NGLs held in inventory. We expect an earnings benefit of approximately $13 million on the forward sales of inventory over the next two quarters; and•an increase of $15 million in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs due to the growth of our operations and higher property insurance premiums.Adjusted EBITDA increased $766 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $702 million related to the Medford incident, due to the settlement gain of $779 million offset partially by $77 million of third-party fractionation costs,•an increase of $93 million in exchange services due primarily to:◦an increase of $113 million from higher volumes primarily in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin,◦an increase of $40 million from lower costs, primarily fuel and power costs, offset partially by◦a decrease of $32 million related to narrower commodity price differentials and lower related volumes, and◦a decrease of $14 million related to lower earnings on unfractionated NGLs held in inventory; offset by•an increase of $40 million in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs and higher outside services costs due to the growth of our operations and higher property insurance premiums.Capital expenditures increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to growth projects.
(a) - Represents physical raw feed volumes for which we provide transportation and/or fractionation services. We generally expect ethane volumes to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in overall NGL production.  However, ethane volumes may experience growth or decline greater than corresponding growth or decline in overall NGL production due to ethane economics causing producers to recover or reject ethane. Volumes increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to increased production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain region, offset partially by lower ethane volumes in the Mid-Continent region and Rocky Mountain region.
Overview - In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, our assets are connected to key supply areas and demand centers, including export markets in Mexico via Roadrunner and supply areas in Canada and the United States via our interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and Northern Border, which enable us to provide essential natural gas transportation and storage services.  Continued demand from local distribution companies, electric-generation facilities and large industrial companies supported low-cost expansions that position us well to provide additional services to our customers when needed. Capital Projects - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment invests in growth projects that provide transportation and storage services to end users.  In December 2022, our Saguaro Connector Pipeline LLC subsidiary filed a Presidential Permit application with the FERC to construct and operate new international border-crossing facilities at the U.S. and Mexico border.  The proposed border facilities would connect upstream with a potential intrastate pipeline, the Saguaro Connector Pipeline, which would be owned and operated by ONEOK.  Additionally, the proposed border facilities would connect at the international boundary with a new pipeline under development in Mexico for delivery to a liquefied natural gas export facility on the west coast of Mexico.  The final investment decision on the pipeline is expected later in 2023. See “Capital Projects” in the “Recent Developments” section for more information on our capital projects.For a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.Selected Financial Results and Operating Information - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Natural Gas Pipelines segment for the periods indicated:
See reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.Adjusted EBITDA increased $10 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $16 million in transportation and storage services due primarily to higher firm and interruptible transportation volumes and higher storage park and loan activity; offset by•an increase of $8 million in operating costs due primarily to higher outside services and employee-related costs due to timing of maintenance activities and the growth of our operations.Adjusted EBITDA increased $31 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase of $38 million in transportation and storage services due primarily to higher storage rates on renegotiated contracts, higher firm and interruptible transportation volumes and higher storage park and loan activity; offset by•an increase of $12 million in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs and outside services due to timing of maintenance activities and the growth of our operations.Capital expenditures increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, due primarily to growth projects, including the Viking compression project.
(a) - Includes volumes for consolidated entities only.In April 2022, the FERC initiated a review of Guardian’s rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act.  In August 2022, Guardian reached a settlement in principle with the participants in the Section 5 rate case.  The FERC approved the settlement in February 2023, which resulted in a reduction of rates starting in April 2023.  The reduced rates did not have a material impact on our results of operations.In July 2023, our subsidiary, Viking, filed a proposed increase in rates pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act with the FERC. The FERC is currently reviewing the filing.  While the ultimate outcome of the filing cannot be predicted, we do not expect it to materially impact our results of operations.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the nearest comparable GAAP financial performance measure, to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:
(a) - The six months ended June 30, 2023 includes $702 million related to the Medford incident, including a settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $77 million of third-party fractionation costs.(b) - Includes costs related to the Merger Transaction of $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.
General - Our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements.  On January 9, 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the Medford incident.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022.  The remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter 2023.  The proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims.  We expect our cash from operations in the remainder of 2023 and in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs resulting from the Medford incident for which we no longer receive business interruption proceeds.We expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures, maturities of long-term debt and contributions to unconsolidated affiliates.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in June 2027, and access to $1 billion available through our “at-the-market” equity program.  As of the date of this report, no shares have been sold through our “at-the-market” equity program.Cash Management - At June 30, 2023, we had $106 million of cash and cash equivalents.  Our cash balance is composed primarily of highly liquid government and Treasury money market funds and deposits fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our nonguarantor operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees.  Our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group.  Our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements.  Under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.Guarantees - ONEOK and ONEOK Partners are issuers of certain public debt securities.  We guarantee certain indebtedness of ONEOK Partners, and ONEOK Partners and the Intermediate Partnership guarantee certain of our indebtedness.  As allowed under Rule 13-01, we have excluded the summarized financial information for each issuer and guarantor as the combined financial information of the subsidiary issuer and parent guarantor, excluding our ownership of all the interests in ONEOK Partners, reflect no material assets, liabilities or results of operations, apart from the guaranteed indebtedness.  For additional information on our and ONEOK Partners indebtedness, please see Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.Short-term Liquidity - Our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our equity-method investments, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 2023, we had no borrowings under our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with all covenants. As of June 30, 2023, we had a working capital surplus of $346 million (defined as current assets less current liabilities).  Generally, our working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) debt and equity issuances, (b) the funding of capital expenditures, (c) scheduled debt payments, and (d) accounts receivable and payable; and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances.  We may have working capital deficits in future periods as we continue to repay long-term debt.  We do not expect a working capital deficit of this nature to have a material adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.For additional information on our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, see Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. Long-term Financing - In addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes, as needed.  Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.Viking Term Loan Agreement - In March 2023, Viking entered into a $60 million senior unsecured Term Loan Agreement which was fully drawn as of June 30, 2023.  The proceeds were used to repay intercompany debt with ONEOK and for general corporate purposes.Debt Repayments - In June 2023, we redeemed our $500 million, 7.5% senior notes due September 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.In June 2023, we made an equity contribution of $105 million to Roadrunner, which, in combination with an equal contribution from our joint venture partner, was used to repay Roadrunner’s outstanding debt. In February 2023, we redeemed our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due September 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.  Bridge Facility Commitment- We intend to finance the cash portion of the Merger Transaction consideration with debt.  In May 2023, we entered into a commitment letter for an unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.25 billion, which is subject to a number of customary conditions.  Prior to the close of the Merger Transaction, we expect to issue senior unsecured notes and terminate the commitment letter undrawn.
Capital Expenditures - We classify expenditures that are expected to generate additional revenue, return on investment or significant operating or environmental efficiencies as growth capital expenditures.  Maintenance capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our existing assets and operations and do not generate additional revenues.  Maintenance capital expenditures are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives.  We proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into supply agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth.  Our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows and short- and long-term debt.Capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were $594 million and $559 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.We expect total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC and capitalized interest, of $1.475-$1.675 billion in 2023.  This range excludes the impact of the pending Merger Transaction.Credit Ratings - Our long-term debt credit ratings as of July 31, 2023, are shown in the table below:
Our credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile or potential transactions.  In April 2023, Moody’s upgraded our long-term rating to Baa2 from Baa3, our short-term rating to Prime-2 from Prime-3 and changed the outlook to stable from positive.  The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity.  If our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement could increase and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur.  In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in 2027.  An adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement.In the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit.  In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties’ evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties.  We may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.Dividends - Holders of our common stock share equally in any common stock dividends declared by our Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock.  In February and May 2023, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.955 per share ($3.82 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 2% compared with the same quarters in the prior year.  A common stock dividend of $0.955 per share was declared in July 2023 for the shareholders of record at the close of business on August 1, 2023, payable August 14, 2023. Our Series E Preferred Stock pays quarterly dividends on each share of Series E Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, at a rate of 5.5% per year.  We paid dividends for the Series E Preferred Stock of $0.3 million in February and May 2023.  Dividends totaling $0.3 million were declared in July 2023 for the Series E Preferred Stock and are payable August 14, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our cash flows from operations exceeded dividends paid by $1.1 billion, due in part to the insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement in the first quarter.  We expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends.  To the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize cash on hand from other sources of short- and long-term liquidity to fund a portion of our dividends.
We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income.  These reconciling items can include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:
Operating Cash Flows - Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows.  Our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our NGLs and natural gas inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, increased $647 million compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement, and higher operating income resulting from higher exchange services in our Natural Gas Liquids segment, higher volumes from increased production and higher average fee rates in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment and higher transportation and storage services in our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, as discussed in “Financial Results and Operating Information.”  The changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $44 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with a decrease of $140 million for the same period in 2022.  This change is due primarily to changes in accounts receivable resulting from the timing of receipt of cash from counterparties and NGLs and natural gas in inventory, both of which vary from period to period and with changes in commodity prices, and changes in risk management assets and liabilities; offset partially by changes in accounts payable, which also vary from period to period with changes in commodity prices, and from the timing of payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties.Investing Cash Flows - Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, decreased $190 million, compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement, offset partially by an equity contribution to Roadrunner which was used to repay Roadrunner’s outstanding debt.Financing Cash Flows - Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, increased $1.0 billion, compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt.
Information about our regulatory, environmental and safety matters can be found in “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” under Part I, Item 1, Business, in our Annual Report.
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.Information about our critical accounting estimates is included under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” in our Annual Report.
Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws.  The forward-looking statements relate to our anticipated financial performance (including projected operating income, net income, capital expenditures, cash flows and projected levels of dividends), liquidity, management’s plans and objectives for our future capital projects and other future operations (including plans to construct additional natural gas and NGL pipelines, processing and fractionation facilities and related cost estimates), our business prospects, the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions and other matters.  We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under federal securities legislation and other applicable laws.  The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements and other statements in this Quarterly Report regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability targets, plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC, or that we will continue to make similar statements in the same extent or manner in future filings.  In addition, historical, current and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards and processes for measuring progress that are still developing and that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.Forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Quarterly Report identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “scheduled,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning.One should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.  Those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices.  In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
