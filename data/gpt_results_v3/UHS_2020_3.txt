Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion does mention several risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's financial performance, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and potential adverse effects on their business operations. This indicates a level of caution and awareness of challenges ahead.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0571 - This ratio indicates that the company has a relatively low level of working capital compared to its total assets, which may raise concerns about its short-term financial health.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.4868 - A high ratio of retained earnings to total assets suggests that the company has been profitable and able to retain earnings to support its operations and growth.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0818 - This ratio shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its total assets, but the figure is relatively low, indicating potential inefficiencies in asset utilization.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.0225 - A ratio above 1 suggests that the company is generating more revenue relative to its total assets, which is a positive indicator of financial performance.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment of caution from the management discussion with the financial ratios, we see a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While the company has a high ratio of retained earnings to total assets, indicating past profitability, the low working capital to total assets ratio raises some concerns about short-term liquidity. The EBIT to Total Assets ratio is also on the lower side, indicating potential inefficiencies in asset utilization. The mention of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other industry risks further adds to the medium level of risk assessment.

Step 4: Medium

Overall, the company exhibits a mix of strengths and weaknesses in its financial indicators and the cautious tone in the management's discussion. While there are positive aspects like high retained earnings and revenue generation, the low working capital and EBIT to Total Assets ratios signal potential challenges. The uncertainties mentioned in the text regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors contribute to the overall assessment of a medium risk of bankruptcy.
