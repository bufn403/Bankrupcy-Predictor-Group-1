Step 1: The management's discussion reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. While the company achieved a profitable quarter, there were significant declines in sales, operating income, net earnings, and earnings per share compared to the prior year. The discussion highlights the challenges posed by the pandemic and the actions taken to manage costs and enhance liquidity. There is an emphasis on the uncertainties related to the near-term operating environment and the need for continuous transformation to adapt to the changing conditions.

Step 2:
- Sales: There was a substantial 23.1% decrease in sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, amounting to $3.5 billion, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. The situation continued in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2021, with a 23.1% decrease ($7.0 billion) in sales compared to the same period in fiscal 2020.
- Operating income: Operating income decreased significantly by 61.6% ($340.4 million) in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and by 48.3% ($589.2 million) in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2021 compared to the respective periods in fiscal 2020.
- Net earnings and Earnings Per Share (EPS): Net earnings decreased by 82.4% ($316.1 million) in the second quarter of 2021, resulting in a decline of 82.7% in basic EPS and 82.4% in diluted EPS. The first 26 weeks of fiscal 2021 saw net earnings decrease by 66.1% ($553.0 million), with corresponding reductions in basic and diluted EPS.

Step 3: The company's significant drop in sales, operating income, net earnings, and EPS indicates a challenging financial performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to manage costs and transform the business, the substantial declines in key financial indicators suggest ongoing struggles and financial distress.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The notable decreases in sales, operating income, net earnings, and EPS, alongside the uncertain operating environment due to the pandemic, indicate a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. The management's discussion emphasizes the financial impact of the pandemic and the ongoing challenges faced, pointing to a precarious financial position that may lead to increased bankruptcy risk.
