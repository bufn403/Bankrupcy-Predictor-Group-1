High risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion appears cautious and realistic, focusing on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. While they highlight areas of growth and steps taken to protect employees and consumers, there is an underlying tone of uncertainty regarding the future outlook due to the ongoing pandemic.

Step 2: The company's net revenues were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with both positive and negative effects on different market segments. While there was revenue growth in developed markets, emerging markets and certain product categories faced declines. The company incurred higher operating costs in response to the pandemic, impacting earnings.

Step 3: The company's Diluted EPS attributable to MondelÄ“z International decreased significantly in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year, driven by various factors including impacts from the Swiss tax reform, costs associated with transactions, and unfavorable mark-to-market impacts. The Adjusted EPS also decreased in the third quarter, impacted by higher taxes and unfavorable currency translation.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, mixed impact on revenues, and decreasing earnings, along with uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic, it is assessed that the company faces a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company's reliance on managing costs and the potential for continued disruptions due to the pandemic highlight this risk. Despite efforts to maintain liquidity and flexibility, the challenging market conditions and reduced earnings pose significant threats to the company's financial stability.
