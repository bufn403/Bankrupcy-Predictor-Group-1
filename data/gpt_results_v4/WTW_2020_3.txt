- Organic Revenue Decline: The organic revenue declined by 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, due to factors like the reduction in demand for discretionary services but was partially offset by growth in other segments.
- Cost Management: Total costs increased by 3% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and 5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, indicating effective cost management strategies during the pandemic.
