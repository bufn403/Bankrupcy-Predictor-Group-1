Step 1: The management's discussion reflects a positive outlook despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company is a leading global provider in its industry, addressing a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical needs. They highlight their contribution to the healthcare sector with advanced delivery technologies, strong intellectual property, and commitment to fulfilling customer needs. Despite acknowledging the pandemic's impacts on global economic activities, the management emphasizes proactive measures taken to protect employees, maintain business operations, and ensure supply chain integrity.

Step 2: 
- Net Revenue Growth: The company experienced significant net revenue growth, attributed to acquisitions, robust demand for biologics offerings, and success in addressing COVID-19-related programs.
- Gross Margin: The gross margin increased substantially, driven by strong margins in all biologics segment offerings and increased revenue across various segments.
- Operating Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased due to acquired company expenses and additional costs related to employee and IT initiatives, somewhat offset by cost savings in certain areas.

Step 3: Despite the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain business aspects like occasional customer delays, the company demonstrated resilience through revenue increases and margin growth, particularly in the biologics segment. The proactive measures implemented to ensure employee safety, maintain operational continuity, and secure the supply chain have so far been effective in mitigating disruptions.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. The company's positive financial performance, significant revenue growth, improved gross margin, and effective cost management strategies indicate financial stability. The management's proactive response to the challenges posed by the pandemic and their focus on customer needs and innovation position the company well to navigate uncertainties ahead, reducing the risk of bankruptcy.
