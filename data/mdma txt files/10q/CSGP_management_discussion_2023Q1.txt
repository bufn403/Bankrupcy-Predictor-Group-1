The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains “forward-looking statements,” including statements about our beliefs and expectations. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated under the heading “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the end of this Item 2 and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of our 2022 Form 10-K, as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.All forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing, and we assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Form 10-K, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC and the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Report.
CoStar Group, founded in 1987, is a leading provider of online real estate marketplaces, information and analytics in the U.S. and U.K. based on the fact that we own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the U.S., based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors; offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available and have the largest commercial real estate research department in the industry. We have created and compiled a standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information. Our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, land, mixed-use and hospitality. We also offer online platforms that manage workflow and marketing for residential real estate agents and brokers and provide portals for homebuyers to view residential property listings. We manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which primarily includes Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.Our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that typically renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of at least one year. Upon renewal, many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual platform usage or number of paid clicks. Depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on one or more of the following factors: the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client’s business focus, the client's geographic location, the number of properties reported on or analyzed, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis. Our transaction-based services primarily consist of auction fees from our Ten-X online auction platform for commercial real estate, which are generally calculated as a percentage of the final sales price for the commercial real estate property sold and recognized as revenue upon the successful closure of an auction. Other transaction-based services are described by service offering below.
Our portfolio of information, analytics and online marketplaces is branded and marketed to our customers and marketplace end users under the primary brands of  CoStar®, LoopNet®, Apartments.com®, STR®, Ten-X®, BizBuySell®, Land.com®, Homesnap®, and Homes.com®. Our services are accessible via the internet and through our mobile applications. Our services are primarily derived from a database of building-specific information and offer customers specialized tools for accessing, analyzing and using our information. Over time, we have enhanced and expanded, and we expect to continue to enhance and expand, our existing information, analytics and online marketplace services. We have developed and we expect to continue to develop additional services leveraging our database to meet the needs of our existing customers as well as potential new categories of customers.Our principal information, analytics and online marketplace services are described in the following paragraphs by type of services:
CoStar is our subscription-based integrated platform for commercial real estate intelligence, which includes information about office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality and student housing properties, properties for sale, comparable sales, tenants, space available for lease, industry professionals and their business relationships, industry news and market status and provides lease analytical, risk management and hospitality benchmarking capabilities. CoStar's revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 slowed compared to the revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022. We expect CoStar's revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 to slow compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of less benefit from customer upgrades as the global product upgrade campaign is substantially complete, a decline in the renewal rate for small brokerages and lower inflation-based price adjustments.
We provide real estate and lease management technology solutions, including lease administration, lease accounting and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager service offerings, as well as portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Risk Analytics service offerings. We also provide benchmarking and analytics for the hospitality industry both on a subscription basis and an ad hoc basis. We earn revenue on ad hoc transactions as reports or data are delivered to customers. We provide information services internationally, through our Business Immo, Belbex and Thomas Daily businesses in France, Spain and Germany, respectively. Information Services' revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 accelerated compared to the revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of inclusion of the revenue from the Business Immo Acquisition and increased sales of STR products. We expect the Information Services revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 to be consistent with the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of lower price adjustments.
Apartments.com is the flagship brand of our apartment marketing network of subscription-based advertising services and provides property management companies and landlords with a comprehensive advertising destination for their available rental units and offers renters a platform for searching for available rentals. This network also earns transaction-based revenue primarily from providing online tenant applications, including background and credit checks and rental payment processing. Multifamily's revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 accelerated compared to the revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of higher sales volumes driven by increases in pricing on renewals and an increase in the number of properties listed on our network. We expect the Multifamily revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 to accelerate compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to expected increases in sales levels from bringing additional properties on the network and customers upgrading ad packages among higher vacancy rates.
Our LoopNet network of commercial real estate websites offers subscription-based, online marketplace services that enable commercial property owners, landlords and real estate agents working on their behalf to advertise properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate agents, buyers and tenants use the LoopNet network of online marketplace services to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. LoopNet's revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 accelerated compared to the revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to an increase in the average price for listings. We expect LoopNet's revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 to accelerate compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to expected increases in sales levels from an increased number of listings on the network.
The acquisitions of Homes.com and Homesnap enabled us to expand our offerings to the residential for sale market. Homes.com is a homes for sale listings site. Homesnap is an online and mobile software platform that provides residential real estate professionals access to applications that manage residential real estate agent workflow and marketing campaigns delivered on third-party platforms. Homesnap also receives transaction-based revenue for short-term advertising delivered on third-party platforms. Residential's revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to the discontinuation of certain products and services that were inconsistent with our long-term business strategy, partially offset by increased sales of Homesnap products and services. We expect Residential's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 to decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the discontinuation of certain non-strategic products and services.
Our other marketplaces include Ten-X, an online auction platform for commercial real estate that was acquired on June 24, 2020. Also included is our BizBuySell network and our Land.com network of sites. The BizBuySell network provides online marketplaces for businesses and franchises for sale, and our Land.com Network provides online marketplaces for rural lands for sale. Other Marketplaces' revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 slowed compared to the revenue growth rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to lower Ten-X transaction revenue. We expect other marketplaces revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 to slow compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower expected sales volumes for our Land.com network.
The majority of our revenue is generated from service offerings that are distributed to our clients under subscription-based agreements that typically renew automatically and have a term of at least one year. We recognize subscription revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our annualized net new bookings of subscription-based services on all contracts were $80 million and $68 million, respectively. Net new bookings is calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales bookings resulting from new subscription-based contracts, changes to existing subscription-based contracts and cancellations of subscription-based contracts for the period reported. Net new bookings is calculated on all subscription-based contracts without regard to contract term. Net new bookings is considered an operating metric that is an indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of sales force productivity by us and investors. However, information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. Revenues from our subscription-based contracts were approximately 95% and 93% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the percentage of our revenue from subscription-based contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due to increased sales in our multifamily subscription products.For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our contract renewal rates for existing company-wide CoStar Group subscription-based services for contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 90% and 91%, respectively, and, therefore, our cancellation rates for those services for the same periods were approximately 10% and 9%, respectively. Contract renewal rates are calculated on all subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year. Our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results. As a result, we believe that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short-term and long-term performance absent extraordinary circumstances. Our trailing twelve-month contract renewal rate may decline as a result of negative economic conditions, consolidations among our clients, reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base. Revenues from our subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 80% and 77% of total revenues for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the percentage of our revenues from our subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year for three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to increased sales of CoStar and multifamily subscription products.
We plan to continue to invest in our business and our services, evaluate strategic growth opportunities and pursue our key priorities as described below. We are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for our client base and site users, including property owners, property managers, buyers, commercial tenants and residential renters and buyers. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, integrate recently completed acquisitions and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. We may reevaluate our priorities as economic conditions continue to evolve.Our key priorities for the remainder of 2023 currently include:•Continuing to develop and invest in the Homes.com residential marketplace. Our residential strategy involves creating new and improved tools for residential agents and brokers and to help homebuyers find a new home and connect with the agents of their choosing. We plan to increase our residential marketing investment over the course of the year to build traffic on the website. •Continuing to invest in our LoopNet marketplace and international business. We plan to invest in additional sales capabilities and increase marketing investment to accelerate revenue growth in LoopNet. This includes further expansion of our LoopNet brand across Europe.•Continuing to invest in CoStar, including:◦Enhancing benchmarking capabilities. We continue to integrate the STR products into our core platform. We plan to apply STR's benchmarking expertise within CoStar by making STAR reports available in the CoStar environment and provide users with tools to perform ad hoc analysis.◦Enhancing analytics capabilities. We are adding information on commercial property investment funds and linking property data to allow fund investors to perform detailed analysis on their property portfolios directly in the CoStar platform.We expect our investment in these priorities, and the full-year impact realized in 2023 from an increase in our sales force which occurred primarily in the second half of 2022, will increase our selling and marketing expense and reduce our income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in order to develop and distribute new services and functionality within our current platform or expand the reach of, or otherwise improve, our current service offerings. Any future product development or expansion of services, combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion, development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures. Any new investments, changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future. Any development efforts must comply with our credit facility, which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business.
In response to the concerns over inflation risk, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in all four quarters of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 and signaled that the federal reserve will maintain a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy in order to return to a modest inflation rate over time. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption around the world. While the impacts of the current economic conditions and COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, they have not materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 or consolidated financial statements for 2022. It is currently unclear how the commercial real estate industry will ultimately be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses formulate and execute plans for employees to return to the office, implement hybrid work arrangements – allowing work from the office or home, or switch to all work from home, or by the current economic conditions. These activities may result in reduced demand for office space and rising interest rates may reduce demand for all types of real estate. If the demand for office space or other real estate decreases significantly, there could be a downturn in the commercial real estate market that may materially adversely affect many of our clients. A depressed commercial real estate market would have a negative impact on our core customer base, which could impact our customers’ ability to subscribe and pay for our services and reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand and increased cancellations could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rates to decline and reduce our profitability.
We prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we may disclose include EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. We typically disclose EBITDA on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. Adjusted EBITDA is different from EBITDA because we further adjust EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues for the period. Non-GAAP net income is determined by adjusting our net income for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents non-GAAP net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of GAAP net income per diluted share.We may disclose adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry.We view EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share as operating performance measures. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income is net income. We believe the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA margin are net income per diluted share and net income divided by revenues, respectively. In calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure, including net income and net income per diluted share. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the GAAP financial information with our EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share.EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when viewed with our GAAP results and accompanying reconciliations, provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business without the impact of certain acquisition-related items. We have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to these acquisitions, our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization; acquisition- and integration-related costs; restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. We believe the disclosure of non-GAAP measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year without the impact of these items. We also believe the non-GAAP measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as amortization and depreciation, and other items, such as interest income or expense, net and other income or expense, net, income taxes, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business, provides additional information about our cost structure, and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts and others have regularly relied on EBITDA and may rely on adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.Set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income:•Amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology, which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.•Depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.•The amount of interest income or expense, net and other income or expense, net we generate and incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows and outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest income or expense, net and other income or expense, net to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.•Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business. However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.•The amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt. However, we do not consider the amount of the loss on debt extinguishment to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.Set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income:•Stock-based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives. Determining the fair value of the stock-based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock-based awards. Therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•The amount of acquisition- and integration-related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because such costs generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions. Because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, we do not consider the amount of acquisition- and integration-related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.•The amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters or impairments on acquired intangible assets. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.•The amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel. Because we do not carry out restructuring activities on a predictable cycle, we do not consider the amount of restructuring-related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.The financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, stock-based compensation, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. These items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted EBITDA together with the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income. In addition to these exclusions from net income, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-GAAP net income. In both 2023 and 2022, we assumed a 26% tax rate, which approximates our historical long-term statutory corporate tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete items.We compensate for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures by using a non-GAAP measure only to supplement our GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to investors to understand the factors and trends affecting our business.
The following table provides a comparison of our selected consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):
Revenues. Revenues increased to $584 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $516 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $69 million, or 13%, increase in our consolidated revenues included:•an increase in Multifamily revenues of $35 million, or 20%, due to higher sales volume driven by increases in pricing on renewals and an increase in the number of properties listed on our network,•an increase in CoStar revenues of $26 million, or 13%, due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in subscribers, as well as, the impact of annual price increases and customer upgrades on contract renewals,•an increase in LoopNet revenues of $9 million, or 16%, due to an increase in the average price for listings,•an increase in Information Services revenues of $4 million, or 12%, primarily attributable to an increase in STR revenue of $2 million and $2 million of revenue related to the Business Immo Acquisition,•a decrease in Residential revenues of $5 million, or 27%, due to the discontinuation of certain products and services that were inconsistent with our long-term business strategy and•a decrease in Other Marketplaces revenues of $1 million, or 4%, driven by lower property volumes auctioned on Ten-X.Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to $465 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $420 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and the gross profit percentage decreased to 80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from 81% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in gross profit was due to higher revenues, partially offset by, an increase in cost of revenues of $24 million, or 25%. The increase in cost of revenues included:•an increase in personnel costs of $20 million related to increased headcount to support our residential research efforts, and increases in salaries and benefits costs for our existing employees and •an increase of $4 million in technology costs to host our database and products.Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased to $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $144 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from 28% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $82 million increase included:•an increase in marketing expenses of $55 million primarily for SEM advertising of our residential brands and •an increase in personnel and events costs of $26 million related to increased headcount in our sales force and increases in commissions expense due to increased sales volumes.Software Development Expenses. Software development expenses increased to $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 10% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $13 million increase included an increase in personnel costs of $12 million related to increased headcount to support our residential research efforts and increases in salaries and benefits costs for our existing employees.General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and was consistent as a percentage of revenues at 15% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. The increase of $12 million included:•an increase in personnel costs of $5 million related to increases in salaries and benefits costs for our existing employees and increased headcount and•an increase of $3 million in professional service costs due to diligence efforts associated with potential acquisitions and legal fees to defend our intellectual property rights.Customer Base Amortization Expense. Customer base amortization expense decreased to $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 2% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization expense related to customer base assets acquired in the acquisitions of LoopNet, Homesnap, ForRent and Ten-X, which have been amortizing on an accelerated basis since the respective acquisitions.Interest Income (Expense), net. Interest income, net was $44 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to interest expense, net of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This change was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our cash equivalents.Other Income, net. Other income, net remained consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased to $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was mostly due to lower income before taxes during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as well as an increase in excess tax benefits for the same period.
We manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which primarily includes Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment EBITDA. Management believes that operating segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments. EBITDA is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further information regarding our segment operating results.Segment Revenues. North America revenues increased to $564 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $498 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $66 million increase in our North America revenues included:•an increase in Multifamily revenues of $35 million due to higher sales volumes driven by increases in pricing on renewals and an increase in the number of properties listed on our network,•an increase in CoStar revenues of $27 million due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in subscribers, as well as, the impact of annual price increases and customer upgrades on contract renewals,•an increase in LoopNet revenues of $8 million due to an increase in the average price for listings,•an increase in Information Services revenues of $2 million primarily attributable to an increase in STR revenue,•a decrease in Residential revenues of $5 million due to the discontinuation of certain products and services that were inconsistent with our long-term business strategy and•a decrease in Other Marketplaces revenues of $1 million driven by lower property volumes auctioned on Ten-X.The $3 million increase in International revenues was primarily attributable to the Business Immo Acquisition.Segment EBITDA. North America EBITDA decreased to $97 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $156 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in North America EBITDA was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, marketing costs, technology hosting costs, professional service fees and sales events costs, partially offset by, increases in revenues described above. International EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased to $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was due to an increases in personnel costs, partially offset by, an increase in revenues described above.
We believe the balance of cash and cash equivalents, which was $5.1 billion as of March 31, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. Other than the construction commitments discussed below, our cash requirements have not changed materially from what is described in the 2022 Form 10-K.Construction Commitments. We plan to expand our Richmond, Virginia campus, which is expected to result in a material cash requirement in 2023 and beyond. We broke ground on the expansion in November 2022 and expect construction to be substantially completed in 2025. We negotiated various tax incentives with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the City of Richmond including the allowance to use market-based income apportionment for income taxes and partial reimbursements of property tax assessments related to the value of the campus expansion. These incentives are conditional upon achieving job creation and capital expenditure targets from 2022 to 2029. Failure to meet these targets could result in a reduction of the value of the tax incentives and repayment of previous tax reductions. The value of the incentives is dependent on our taxable income.We expect the total cost of construction, net of the estimated value of the tax incentives from 2023 to 2032, to be in the range of $450 – $550 million. We have engaged a project manager, architects and a general contractor on terms that generally require payments as services are provided or construction is performed. As of March 31, 2023, we have paid $33 million and we have committed to spend an additional $426 million as further work is performed under these contracts. We plan to amend these contracts to include additional commitments as construction progresses. Total cash expenditures for 2023 are expected to be approximately $170 million. We expect to fund the expansion with cash on hand.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others, our operating results, expansion and integration efforts, and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions. To date, we have grown in part by acquiring other companies, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions.Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $5.1 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $123 million. This increase was partially offset by $20 million of cash used in investing activities, primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment, including the purchase of assets related to the expansion of our campus in Richmond, Virginia and cash used in financing activities of $16 million primarily related to repurchases of restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was approximately $123 million compared to approximately $131 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to:•a decrease of $13 million due to changes in working capital,•a decrease of $2 million in net income for three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 and•an increase of $8 million in non-cash operating expenses driven primarily by recognizing less deferred tax benefits for research and development costs and higher stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was approximately $20 million compared to approximately $12 million of cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The $7 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash paid related to the expansion of our campus in Richmond, Virginia.Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 did not change significantly compared to the cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. The following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different acceptable assumptions would yield different results. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary. We consider  policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:•Long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill;•Income taxes;•Revenue recognition and•Business combinations.For an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including the related critical accounting estimates and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Report. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described in the 2022 Form 10-K.
