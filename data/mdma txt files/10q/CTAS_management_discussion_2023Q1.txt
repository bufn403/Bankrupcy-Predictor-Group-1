Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, for the two reportable operating segments and All Other are presented in Note 11 entitled Segment Information of “Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.”
Total revenue increased 11.7% to $2,190.0 million for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $1,960.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2022. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 11.8%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.3% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.4% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue was $1,716.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $1,553.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year, which was an increase of 10.5%. The organic revenue growth rate for this reportable operating segment was 10.8%. Revenue growth in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was positively impacted by 0.2% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.5% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives.Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 16.4% for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, from $407.2 million to $473.8 million. The organic revenue growth rate for other revenue was 15.8%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.7% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $73.9 million, or 8.9%, for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022. This change from the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume, as well as investments in material cost to support increased revenue growth achieved during the three months ended February 28, 2023.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms, and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased $19.7 million, or 8.6%, for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to increased sales volume in each of the underlying operating segments. Cost of other improved as a percentage of revenue, decreasing from 56.1% for three months ended February 28, 2022, to 52.3% for the three months ended February 28, 2023. The improvement in cost of sales as a percent to revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment as well as improved leverage of fixed costs for both the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $96.7 million, or 19.7%, in the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to increases in labor and other employee-partner expenses as well as a one-time gain on an equity method investment transaction of $30.2 million recorded in the three months ended February 28, 2022. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 26.8% for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to 25.0% for the same period in the prior fiscal year.

The decrease in operating income as a percent of revenue was due to previously mentioned gain on an equity method investment transaction recorded in the three months ended February 28, 2022.Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $28.4 million for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $22.0 million for the three months ended February 28, 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in interest rates on outstanding debt, specifically commercial paper, during the three months ended February 28, 2023 compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022. Cintas’ effective tax rate was 22.1% and 18.2% for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. In addition, the effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2022 included a one-time tax benefit from a gain on an equity method investment transaction.Net income for the three months ended February 28, 2023 increased $10.4 million, or 3.3%, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $3.14 for the three months ended February 28, 2023, which was an increase of 5.7% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to the increase in net income combined with the decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing an aggregate of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock under the board approved share buyback programs since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2022 through the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was 26.1% compared to the 23.4% in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. The change as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the previously mentioned one-time gain on an equity method investment transaction of $30.2 million recorded in the three months ended February 28, 2022, as well as investments in selling resources in the three months ended February 28, 2023. Income before income taxes increased $4.0 million, or 1.1%, for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment for the three months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was 21.0% of the reportable operating segment’s revenue, which was a 190 basis point decrease from the third quarter of the prior fiscal year of 22.9%. This decrease as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the previously discussed increase in selling and administrative expenses partially offset by the improvements in gross margin.

Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue were 26.8% for the nine months ended February 28, 2023, compared to 26.0% for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the $12.1 million gain on the sale of certain operating assets recorded within the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment and a one-time gain on an equity method investment transaction of $30.2 million recorded in the nine months ended February 28, 2022.

The following is a summary of our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the nine months ended February 28:
Cash and cash equivalents as of February 28, 2023 and 2022, include $40.4 million and $38.4 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. We expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,044.2 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023, compared to $987.1 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2022. The change from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital, specifically current income taxes, accrued liabilities and accounts payable. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically, accounts receivable, inventories and capitalized contract costs, which resulted from the growth in revenue.Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments, proceeds from sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $224.1 million and $165.9 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures in the nine months ended February 28, 2023, included $155.9 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $47.6 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. The increase in capital expenditures during the nine months ended February 28, 2023 over the same period in the prior fiscal year is due to an investment in the operating segments to support continued market penetration and revenue growth. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses was $33.0 million and $150.8 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The acquisitions during both the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. During the nine months ended February 28, 2022, the Company received proceeds of $15.3 million from the sale of certain operating assets, net of cash disposed in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, which is included in All Other. Net cash used in investing activities also includes $4.6 million and $6.0 million of purchases of investments during the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $774.6 million and $1,078.6 million for the nine months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the decrease in share buyback activity and debt payments partially offset by the increase in dividends paid in the nine months ended February 28, 2023. On October 29, 2019, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. On July 27, 2021, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. From the inception of the July 27, 2021 share buyback program through February 28, 2023, Cintas purchased a total of 2.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $385.62 per share for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion. On July 26, 2022, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. The following table summarizes the buyback activity by program for the nine months ended February 28:
(1)  Shares of Cintas common stock acquired for employee payroll taxes due on options exercised and vested restricted stock awards.Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
(1)  The dividends declared during the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 were included in current accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheet at February 28, 2023 and 2022. Any future dividend declarations, including the amount of any dividends, are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and dependent upon then-existing conditions, including the Company's consolidated operating results and consolidated financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the nine months ended February 28, 2023, Cintas paid a net $62.2 million of commercial paper. During the nine months ended February 28, 2022, Cintas issued a net $559.2 million of commercial paper. On June 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the notes, Cintas paid the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.30%, 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand. The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt:
(1)   Variable rate debt instrument. The rate presented is the variable borrowing rate at February 28, 2023.(2)  Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (3)    Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has a revolving credit facility with a capacity of $2.0 billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of February 28, 2023, there was $199.0 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.79% and maturity dates less than 90 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2022, there was $261.2 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.20% and maturity dates less than 90 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility.Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of February 28, 2023, our ratings were as follows:
In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit.
