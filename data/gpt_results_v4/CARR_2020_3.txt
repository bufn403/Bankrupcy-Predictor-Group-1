Step 1: The management discussion in the 10-Q filing indicates a challenging environment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions in the supply chain, and financial markets. They are taking measures to mitigate these effects, such as implementing work-from-home policies, social distancing protocols, and cost-cutting initiatives.

Step 2:
- Revenue Decline: The company experienced a decline in total net sales during the period due to various factors, such as weakness in foreign currencies and the impact of COVID-19 on demand.
- Additional Debt Issuance: The company issued a significant amount of debt in connection with the Separation from UTC, which could increase financial leverage and interest payment obligations.
- Additional Expenses: The company incurred and is expected to continue to incur increased costs associated with becoming an independent, publicly traded company, primarily related to establishing corporate functions, which could strain profitability.

Step 3: The company's financial performance was adversely affected by the external factors, such as the pandemic, leading to lower sales volumes and increased expenses beyond the historically allocated costs from UTC. The significant debt issuance and the ongoing need to incur additional costs post-Separation indicate financial strain.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The combination of declining revenues, substantial debt issuance, increased expenses, and ongoing challenges related to the pandemic suggests a high risk of financial distress for the company. The need to manage additional corporate expenses and the impact of the pandemic on demand further exacerbate the financial risks.
