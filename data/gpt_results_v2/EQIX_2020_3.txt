Step 1: The sentiment of the management discussion appears optimistic based on statements regarding global expansion, customer growth, and the benefits of the company's offerings. For example, "Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs."

Step 2: The company has shown growth in revenues in both the Americas and EMEA regions, with incremental revenues from recent acquisitions and expansions contributing to the increase. This indicates positive momentum in the company's operations. For instance, "During the three months ended September 30, 2020, EMEA revenue increased by 13% (14% on a constant currency basis)."

The company has also taken precautionary measures to ensure operational continuity. The management has highlighted the resilience of their business model and diverse customer base. 

In conclusion, based on the optimistic sentiment, revenue growth in multiple regions, and successful mitigation of pandemic-related disruptions, the company shows a low risk of bankruptcy.
