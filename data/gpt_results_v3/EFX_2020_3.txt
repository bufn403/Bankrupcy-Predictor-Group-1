Final Decision: Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. While there are mentions of revenue growth in certain segments, there are also discussions about revenue declines in international markets and various verticals, which may pose challenges. The management is actively managing costs and implementing plans to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets ratio (-0.0539) indicates that the company may have difficulty covering its short-term liabilities with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Positive retained earnings to total assets ratio (0.4567) is a good sign as it shows that a significant portion of assets are financed by earnings which have been retained.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): EBIT to total assets ratio (0.0781) indicates that the company is generating a modest return on its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): Total revenue to total assets ratio (0.4287) indicates that the company generates a significant amount of revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: The financial ratios present a mixed picture. While the company has positive retained earnings and generates substantial revenue relative to its assets, the negative working capital ratio and modest EBIT to total assets ratio suggest some level of financial strain, especially during the challenging economic environment brought about by the pandemic.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, along with the mixture of financial ratios indicating both strengths and weaknesses, the company is assessed to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. The impact of the pandemic on revenue and the negative working capital ratio contribute to this assessment. The company's ability to navigate through the ongoing challenges will be crucial in determining its future financial health.
