Step 1: The management discussion provides a detailed overview of Broadridge's business segments, financial services, client base, and operational strategies. Though the discussion doesn't explicitly indicate financial difficulties, it mentions significant events like the impact of COVID-19 on operations, cost control measures taken, and the potential future implications of the pandemic. While there is no direct pessimism, the cautious tone regarding potential future impacts raises some concerns.

Step 2: 
- Revenue Increase: The discussion highlights a 9% increase in revenues, driven by recurring fee revenues, event-driven fee revenues, and distribution revenues. The growth in revenues can be seen as positive for the company.
- Increase in Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased by 4%, primarily due to higher distribution costs, proxy fulfillment expenses, and operating costs from acquisitions. This rise in expenses may indicate a strain on profitability.
- Impact of COVID-19: The pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, causing disruptions in financial markets and supply chains. Although Broadridge maintained operations, uncertainties related to future impacts remain.

Step 3: The increase in revenues, especially from recurring fee revenues, signifies the company's ability to attract new business and sustain growth. However, the rise in operating expenses, coupled with the ongoing impact of COVID-19, poses challenges to the company's profitability in the future. The efforts to continue operations amidst the pandemic are commendable but may not be sustainable in the long term if uncertainties persist.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company's revenue growth is a positive indicator, the increase in operating expenses and the lingering impact of the pandemic suggest potential financial strain. The uncertainties surrounding the future effects of COVID-19 on operations and financial performance warrant a cautious outlook, indicating a medium risk of bankruptcy.
