    - Quote: "The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant decline in commodity prices as well as decreased demand for products refined from crude oil significantly impacted our financial results in the first nine months of 2020, and are expected to negatively impact our future results."
    
Step 2: The discussion mentions a significant decline in financial results due to external factors.
    - Quote: "Our revenues for the first nine months of 2020 were $97.9 billion, a decrease of 42% from the same period in 2019."
