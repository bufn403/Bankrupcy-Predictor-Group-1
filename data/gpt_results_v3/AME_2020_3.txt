Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious but with a hint of optimism. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes their focus on maintaining business continuity and addressing changing conditions. For example, they state, "...volatility in demand for some of our products as our customers adapt to the evolving environment." This indicates a realistic acknowledgment of the current market conditions.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) is negative, indicating potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) at 66.17% shows a healthy portion of assets being financed by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) at 11.24% reflects operational efficiency.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) at 43.91% shows a decent utilization of assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: The company has faced a decrease in net sales and income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, they have implemented cost-saving measures and strategic acquisitions to mitigate losses. The quote, "The Company recorded 2020 realignment costs totaling $43.9 million...in response to the impact of a weak global economy," indicates proactive steps taken to address challenges. These actions have resulted in the company maintaining a strong financial position, as mentioned, "Our financial position remains strong...to respond to changing conditions."

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, the mix of financial ratios indicating some areas of concern (like negative working capital to total assets), and efforts by the company to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic effectively, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. They have both strengths and areas that need attention, making the overall risk moderate.
