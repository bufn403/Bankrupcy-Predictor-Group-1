Step 1: The company's management discussion provides a comprehensive overview of Pfizer's operations, emphasizing their commitment to developing healthcare products and vaccines to improve lives. The discussion also addresses significant industry-specific challenges, such as intellectual property rights, healthcare legislation, competition, and regulatory factors.

Step 2:
- Revenue Decrease: The company experienced a decrease in revenues, reflecting operational declines, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, and challenges like the loss of exclusivity of certain products. This decrease could indicate potential financial strain.
- Business Development Activities: Pfizer has engaged in various strategic business development activities, such as collaborations with CStone Pharmaceuticals and BioNTech for vaccine development. These activities suggest efforts to drive growth and innovation.

Step 3: 
- Revenue Challenges: The revenue decrease, especially due to factors like loss of exclusivity of key products and lower demand in certain markets, poses financial challenges for the company.
- COVID-19 Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions and decreased demand for certain products, impacting revenue. While Pfizer is actively involved in combating the pandemic, the ongoing uncertainties from it can affect the company's financial stability.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite engaging in strategic business development activities, the significant revenue decrease and ongoing challenges from factors like loss of exclusivity and the impact of COVID-19 pose financial risks to Pfizer. The company's commitment to developing vaccines and talent in the healthcare industry may provide some cushion; however, the financial strains indicated by the revenue decrease suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy.
