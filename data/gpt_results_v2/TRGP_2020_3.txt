Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and hints at challenges due to economic conditions. The statement "We believe we have sufficient access to financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service payments and capital expenditures through the remainder of 2020 and beyond" shows a level of uncertainty and the need to ensure financial stability.

Step 2: The relevant numbers provided indicate a decline in commodity prices and reduction in planned capital expenditures. The statement "we announced a reduction in the Companyâ€™s quarterly common dividend" and "we reduced our estimated 2020 net growth capital expenditures" highlight financial adjustments made to cope with decreased demand and prices.

Step 3: The figures suggest a challenging quarter with lower investments and reduced volumes processed. Despite some recovery, uncertainties persist. The statement "Reduced economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic...has contributed to depressed crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas prices" underlines the ongoing difficulties.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, reduced expenditures, and ongoing economic uncertainties, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The measures taken to conserve cash and adapt to market conditions indicate some level of financial strain, but the ability to meet requirements through 2020 and beyond suggests a moderate level of risk.
