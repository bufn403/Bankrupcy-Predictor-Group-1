Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion reflects a realistic assessment of both positive and negative factors affecting the company. While the company acknowledges the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, it also highlights its efforts in adapting to the situation by implementing work-from-home setups and maintaining effective financial operations. There is a cautious approach taken towards managing spending, adjusting hiring pace, reducing discretionary spending, and focusing on critical digital transformation projects.

Step 2: 
- Revenue Growth: The company experienced an increase in revenue during the period, driven partly by growth in lease license revenue and maintenance revenue, partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue and service revenue. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenue is also highlighted.
- Operating Expenses: The company saw increased operating expenses primarily due to higher personnel costs, stock-based compensation, and expenses related to acquisitions. The company adjusted spending, slowed hiring pace, and reduced non-headcount-related discretionary spending in response to the pandemic.

Step 3: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the company's revenue and operational expenses. Despite the challenges, the company demonstrated resilience by adapting to remote work setups and maintaining effective financial operations. The explicit acknowledgment of the economic impacts of the pandemic and the company's proactive measures in adjusting spending indicate a level of awareness and preparedness in managing the crisis.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company faces challenges from the ongoing pandemic, impacting revenue streams and necessitating cost-adjustment measures. While the company has shown resilience and adaptability in the face of these challenges, the adverse effects on revenue and continued uncertainties in the global economic conditions suggest a medium level of bankruptcy risk. Continued vigilance and strategic financial management will be crucial for the company to navigate through the uncertain times ahead.
