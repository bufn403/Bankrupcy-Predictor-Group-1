Step 1: The management's discussion includes precautionary language about forward-looking statements to warn readers about uncertainties. It's mentioned that forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and the actual results may differ from what is indicated. This cautious tone indicates potential challenges ahead.

Step 2: 
- In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the company experienced higher net sales in their retail segments due to increased at-home food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was a decrease in net sales in their Foodservice segment due to lower traffic in away-from-home food outlets.
- Despite the increase in net sales, the company faced challenges such as higher transportation costs, employee safety, sanitation costs, and employee compensation costs due to the pandemic. These factors could impact the company's profitability and financial health.

Step 3: The company's operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 showed an increase in net sales in the retail segments but a decrease in the Foodservice segment due to changing consumer behavior during the pandemic. The cost challenges faced by the company may have strained its profitability even with higher sales, indicating a weakening financial position.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The cautious language around forward-looking statements, the challenges faced in the operational performance despite increased net sales, and the uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggest a high risk of bankruptcy. The increased costs and the potential impact on profitability point towards financial distress that could lead to a higher risk of bankruptcy.
