High

Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is quite bleak due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. The pandemic has resulted in reduced demand across various segments and a global recession affecting customer industries.

Step 2: 
- Aerospace Segment: Sales and profits declined due to the negative impact of reduced global travel on customers, resulting in lower demand for products from OEMs and aftermarket businesses.
- Performance Materials and Technologies Segment: Sales decreased significantly due to lower demand from customers in the oil and gas industry, influenced by the global travel decline and excess oil and gas supply.

Step 3: The company faced challenges in several segments due to reduced demand caused by the global recession and the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for cost reduction programs, canceled merit increases, reduced work schedules, and permanent reductions in workforce indicate financial strain. Initiating liquidity measures like public Senior Notes offerings suggest a need for additional capital.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The significant decline in sales, impacts across multiple segments, implementation of cost reduction programs, and the need to secure additional liquidity all point towards a financially challenging situation for the company. The adverse effects of the pandemic on customer industries, coupled with the ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19, pose a high risk of bankruptcy for the company in the near future.
