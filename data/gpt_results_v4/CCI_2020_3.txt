Step 3: While the company's financial transactions indicate active management of its capital structure, the dependency on debt instruments and the continuous need for refinancing or redemption may pose long-term financial risks.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The complex debt structure, reliance on continuous refinancing, and limitations imposed by debt covenants highlight potential financial constraints that could escalate the risk of bankruptcy, especially if economic conditions worsen or financial management becomes more challenging.
