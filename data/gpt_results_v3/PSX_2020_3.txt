Decision: Medium

Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is predominantly pessimistic, detailing the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance. The text mentions, "During the first nine months of 2020, we took the following significant steps to enhance our liquidity in this challenged margin environment," indicating a challenging business environment.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0541 - This ratio is low, indicating that the company may have a limited ability to cover its short-term obligations with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.4046 - This ratio is moderate, suggesting that a reasonable portion of total assets is funded by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1377 - This ratio is relatively low, implying that the company's earnings generated from its assets are not very high.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.9523 - This ratio is high, indicating that the company generates significant revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the text analysis with the financial ratios, it is evident that while the company is taking measures to enhance liquidity and manage costs, the overall financial performance has been impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant steps taken to boost liquidity, along with impairment charges and decreased earnings, point towards a challenging quarter. The decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and the adverse effects of the pandemic have further strained the company's operations.

Step 4: Taking into account the sentiment of the text, the financial ratios, and the outlook presented, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The pessimistic tone of the management's discussion, coupled with the low working capital ratio and moderate EBIT to total assets ratio, indicates a level of financial vulnerability despite efforts to enhance liquidity. The high total revenue to total assets ratio may offer some buffer, but the overall picture suggests a medium level of risk.
