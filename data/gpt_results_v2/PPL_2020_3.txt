The uncertainties surrounding these factors could lead to financial instability if not addressed proactively.

Based on the assessment of the sentiment, financial figures, and future outlook provided in the filing, the company demonstrates signs of high bankruptcy risk due to the mentioned challenges and uncertainties.
