Decision: High Risk

Step 1: The sentiment in the management discussion appears to be cautious and highlights challenges faced by the company. The text mentions impacts of COVID-19 on operations and financial results, temporary closures of manufacturing facilities, and actions taken to address the financial impact.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.1469 - This ratio indicates a relatively lower level of working capital in relation to total assets, which could suggest potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.1649 - The ratio shows a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to total assets, indicating some stability in the company's earnings retention.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1144 - The EBIT to total assets ratio is on the lower side, suggesting that the company is generating less operating profit relative to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.6367 - This ratio indicates that the company is generating a significant amount of revenue in relation to its total assets, which is a positive sign.

Step 3:
Combining the sentiment from the management discussion and the financial ratios, it is evident that the company is facing challenges, especially with lower sales, reduced segment operating profits, and impacts from COVID-19. The relatively low working capital to total assets ratio and low EBIT to total assets ratio raise concerns about the company's liquidity and profitability in the current environment.

Step 4:
Final Decision: High Risk

Overall, the company's cautious tone in the management discussion, coupled with the relatively weaker financial ratios, particularly the low working capital to total assets and EBIT to total assets ratios, indicate a higher risk of bankruptcy. The challenging quarter faced by the company, as outlined in the text, further supports this assessment.
