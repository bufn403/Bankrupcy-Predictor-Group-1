Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious, acknowledging the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. While there is a focus on growth strategies and positive indicators like increased recurring revenue, there are concerns about the uncertainties related to the pandemic and its potential long-term effects. The management's tone is a blend of optimism regarding revenue growth and caution due to the ongoing challenges: "Although revenue and operating income increased for the third quarter, as the COVID-19 pandemic is continually evolving, we are uncertain of its ultimate duration, the nature and extent of the impact to our business, our condensed consolidated results of operations, and our financial condition."
  
Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The working capital to total assets ratio is very low (0.0001677), indicating potential liquidity concerns as the company might be relying heavily on assets to support its operations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio is moderate (0.2555), suggesting that the company has a decent proportion of earnings retained for future investments or to cover potential losses.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to total assets ratio is also at a moderate level (0.0543), indicating that the company is generating some earnings in relation to its total assets but not at a high level.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The total revenue to total assets ratio is below 1 (0.3982), indicating that the company's total revenue is less than its total assets, which could signal inefficiencies in asset utilization.

Step 3: By combining the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, the low liquidity indicated by the working capital ratio, and the moderate profitability shown by the EBIT ratio, it appears that the company is facing some financial challenges. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenue and operations further adds to the uncertainty. While there are positive aspects like increased recurring revenue, the overall circumstances seem to pose a medium level of risk.

Step 4: After analyzing the sentiment, financial ratios, and overall outlook, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The caution expressed by management, alongside the financial ratios indicating liquidity concerns and moderate profitability, suggest a level of financial instability that warrants attention and proactive measures. Although there are positive growth strategies in place, the current uncertainties and challenges imply a medium risk level.
