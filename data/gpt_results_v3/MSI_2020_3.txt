Final Decision: Low

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is fairly optimistic. The company discusses adapting to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating liquidity adequacy, and focusing on mission-critical solutions. They state, "we continue to evaluate our financial position during this economic slowdown" and "we have assessed the adequacy of our liquidity." This reflects a proactive approach to maintaining financial stability. Additionally, the company discusses growth in certain segments and efficiency measures to counter the impact of reduced demand.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The negative value of -0.0008248350329934 for this ratio indicates that the company may have more liabilities than assets in the short term, which could be a concern. However, this should be interpreted alongside other indicators.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.1229754049190161, this ratio suggests that the company has a reasonable amount of retained earnings relative to its total assets, which is positive for long-term financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio of 0.1795890821835633 indicates that the company is generating a moderate level of earnings relative to its total assets, which is a good sign for profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.7482003599280144 shows that the company is effectively utilizing its total assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: The combination of the optimistic tone in the management discussion, the moderate financial ratios, and the adaptability shown by the company during economic challenges suggests that the company is managing its financial health well. Despite some areas of concern, such as negative working capital, the overall outlook seems stable. The company's focus on liquidity, efficiency measures, and growth in certain segments indicates a proactive approach.

Step 4: The analysis of the sentiment in the management discussion along with the financial ratios leads to the conclusion that the company has a low risk of bankruptcy. While there are areas for improvement, the company's resilience, proactive measures, and overall financial stability suggest a positive outlook for the future.
