Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion appears to be a mix of optimism and caution. The company highlights collaborations and advancements in their pipeline, but also acknowledges challenges from patent expirations, regulatory environments, and price constraints imposed by payers and governments.

Step 4: Based on the analysis of the sentiment, financial numbers, and future outlook provided in the filing, the company appears to face significant challenges, including patent expirations, regulatory hurdles, and pricing pressures. While the company is actively engaged in collaborations and pipelines, the current revenue declines and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic contribute to a medium risk of bankruptcy.
