Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While they acknowledge the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business, they also highlight strong volume growth and revenue increases in certain segments.

Step 2: The company reported revenue growth, with revenue increasing by 15.9% for the quarter compared to the previous year. They also noted a 13.5% increase in average daily package volume. Operating profit for the quarter increased by $235 million or 11.0%.

Step 3: Despite the revenue and volume growth, the company's operating profit declined year to date, and they mentioned that operating expenses increased due to volume growth, which could continue to compress operating margins. They also stated that if they are unable to optimize volume in their network and adjust pricing and costs, operating margins will continue to be compressed.

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious optimism in the sentiment, the revenue and volume growth with a decline in operating profit year to date, and the potential for compressed operating margins if volume optimization is not achieved, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the pandemic adds to the risk factor.
