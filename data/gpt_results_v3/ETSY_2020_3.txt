Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is optimistic. The company highlights its strong performance during the third quarter of 2020, with significant growth in GMS and revenue. They mention initiatives to drive buyer engagement, increase frequency, and enhance the buying experience. Additionally, they emphasize the positive impact of their strategies, such as increasing active buyers and sellers, launching new features, and improving search and discovery.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio is 0.32, indicating that the company has a positive working capital position relative to its total assets. This suggests a relatively healthy liquidity position.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The ratio is -0.51, suggesting that retained earnings are negative relative to total assets. This could indicate past losses impacting the company's financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio is 0.11, representing the company's EBIT relative to its total assets. A positive ratio suggests profitability, but the value is relatively low.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio is 1.02, indicating that total revenue is slightly more than total assets. This could imply efficient asset utilization.

Step 3: The combination of the optimistic sentiment in the management discussion and the relatively positive financial ratios indicates that the company had a successful quarter in terms of growth and revenue generation. However, the negative retained earnings ratio may raise concerns about the company's historical financial performance.

Step 4: The company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While the optimistic tone and positive financial ratios signal a successful quarter, the negative retained earnings ratio and potentially limited profitability as indicated by the low EBIT to Total Assets ratio suggest a degree of financial vulnerability. The company should closely monitor its financial performance and address any historical losses to improve its financial stability.
