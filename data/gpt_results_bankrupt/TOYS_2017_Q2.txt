Step 1: Analyze the overall sentiment of the management's discussion, and whether it is optimistic or pessimistic.
The management's discussion appears somewhat optimistic as they highlight the global reach of their business and emphasize their omnichannel approach leveraging both brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. However, they acknowledge challenges such as declines in same store sales.

Step 2: Observe relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion, such as future projections or percentage changes.
The financial data provided shows a decline in net sales by $113 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decline in same store sales. The net loss attributable to Toys “R” Us, Inc. increased by $38 million.

Step 3: Determine whether the numbers and figures represent a successful or failed quarter, and if the conditions are likely to improve or worsen.
The decrease in net sales and increase in net loss indicate a challenging quarter. Same store sales declined significantly, indicating weakening consumer demand, particularly in key categories like baby and seasonal products. While they mention some improvements in e-commerce sales, it's not enough to offset the decline in overall sales.

Step 4: Output your final decision on whether the company has a low, medium, or high risk of bankruptcy in the future, taking the sentiment, numbers, and future outlook into account.
Considering the decline in net sales, increased loss, and challenges in same store sales, the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite some optimistic sentiment expressed in the filing, the financial figures indicate underlying challenges that need to be addressed to avoid a higher risk of bankruptcy.
