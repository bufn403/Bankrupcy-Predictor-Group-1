Step 1: The management's discussion contains various forward-looking statements discussing Applied's future financial results, operations, market trends, and factors affecting the business. While it's positive that the company has been identified as part of the Critical Infrastructure Sectors by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and has implemented precautionary measures to ensure operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous risks and uncertainties are highlighted in the forward-looking statements, indicating a degree of caution.

- Gross Margins: The gross margins for the different segments, such as Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets, varied during the periods reported. While gross margins increased in some segments due to higher net sales and favorable product mixes, they were also impacted by factors like travel restrictions, increased costs, and changes in customer spending patterns.

Step 3: The company's business is subject to significant variability as customer investments, market demand, technological advancements, and supply chain conditions influence its financial performance. The management's mention of the impact of COVID-19 on operations and financial results indicates ongoing challenges. While there have been increases in net sales in certain segments, the fluctuations in sales across regions and segments, coupled with the uncertainties discussed, highlight a level of instability in operating conditions.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The fluctuations in net sales, changes in gross margins, and the uncertain market conditions, as expressed in the forward-looking statements, indicate a high level of risk associated with the company's financial stability. The variability in performance across segments and regions, along with the caution expressed in the forward-looking statements regarding the impact of external factors, suggest a precarious financial position that could lead to a high risk of bankruptcy in the future.
