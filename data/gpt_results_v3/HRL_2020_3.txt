Decision: Low

Step 1: The overall sentiment from the management's discussion appears to be cautiously optimistic despite the challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company outlines various measures taken to ensure employee safety, adapt to changing demand patterns, and maintain liquidity. Quote from the text: "The Company believes its balanced business model and strong balance sheet makes it well-positioned to weather the pandemic."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.073 implies a positive working capital, indicating the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.557 indicates a strong proportion of earnings reinvested in assets, showcasing financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0808 signifies the company's ability to generate earnings relative to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.9004 shows a high revenue generation capability compared to total assets. 

Step 3: The combination of positive sentiment in the management discussion, along with the healthy financial ratios, suggests that the company is managing its resources effectively and adapting well to the current economic challenges. Despite facing adverse effects from the pandemic, the company's strategies and financial strengths seem to mitigate the risks. Quote from the text: "The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants and remains confident in its ability to meet cash flow needs."

Step 4: Considering the cautiously optimistic sentiment, along with the positive financial ratios and the company's proactive measures, the overall assessment leads to a low risk classification for bankruptcy. The company's ability to adapt, maintain liquidity, and focus on employee safety and growth initiatives indicate a resilient and stable financial position in the current scenario.
