Medium Risk

Step 1: Analyzing the overall sentiment of the management's discussion, it appears to be a mix of optimism and caution. While they highlight the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they also emphasize their strategic initiatives and market positioning for long-term growth.

Step 2: Observing relevant numbers and figures, we see that there was a decline in comparable store used unit sales, an increase in delinquencies initially but a subsequent decline, and a decrease in other sales and revenues.

Step 3: The conditions have been challenging due to the pandemic, resulting in reduced sales, store closures, and lower consumer demand. However, the company has implemented measures to adapt, such as launching contactless services and focusing on omni-channel experiences.

Based on the above analysis, the company shows medium risk of bankruptcy. While they have faced challenges and declines in certain areas, their strategic initiatives, strong liquidity position, and focus on customer experience position them to recover and grow in the long term. The measures taken during the pandemic also reflect adaptability and resilience.
