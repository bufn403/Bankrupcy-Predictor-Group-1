Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and highlights the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and tenants. This is evident in statements such as, "Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-process projects have stopped or slowed significantly while we evaluate current market conditions and assess the feasibility of these projects."

Step 2: The company experienced a decline of 11.9% in pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, primarily due to uncollectible lease income during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the company mentions that occupancy decreased from 94.8% to 92.9% primarily driven by bankruptcies and COVID-19 related tenant move-outs.

Step 3: The company's same property portfolio was 93.4% leased, showing a decrease from the previous year. The statement suggests that bankruptcies and COVID-19 related tenant move-outs have impacted the company's occupancy rates, indicating a challenging quarter.

The negative financial impacts outlined in the filing indicate that the company is facing significant challenges that may affect its financial stability.
