Step 1: Analyze overall sentiment
The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be mixed. While there are mentions of key developments that have impacted the business, such as revenue decreases and losses, there is also an emphasis on strategic initiatives and cost reduction efforts. However, the language used does not convey a sense of urgency or significant concern.

Step 2: Observe relevant numbers and figures

Consolidated revenue decreased $29.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. Excluding the impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $39.4 million. This indicates a decline in revenue, which is a concerning sign.
Consolidated direct operating expenses increased $30.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. Higher direct operating expenses in the iHM business were partially offset by lower expenses in the outdoor advertising businesses due to the sale of certain businesses. However, the overall increase in expenses is not favorable.
Step 3: Determine successful or failed quarter and future outlook
The quarter experienced a decrease in revenue and an increase in direct operating expenses, which suggests a challenging operating environment. While strategic initiatives to reduce costs are mentioned, the extent of their effectiveness is unclear. Additionally, the loss on sale of businesses and the exchange of notes highlight financial challenges. The discussion does not provide a strong indication of a successful quarter or a promising future outlook.

Step 4: Final decision
Taking into account the mixed sentiment, declining revenue, increasing expenses, and financial challenges highlighted in the discussion, the company appears to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are efforts to address the issues, the overall financial performance raises concerns about the company's future stability.
