Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion appears cautious, given the numerous risk factors highlighted, such as federal, state, and local regulatory trends, impacts of possible cost increases due to climate change legislation, threats of cyber-attacks, and the ongoing risk of COVID-19 on business and economic conditions.
