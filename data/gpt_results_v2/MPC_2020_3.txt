High Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion appears to be pessimistic due to the significant economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is evident in the statement, "Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals, and companies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings, and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction in the areas where we operate, which has impacted demand for our products."

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided include a loss in the Refining & Marketing segment, impairment charges, and restructuring expenses. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, net income (loss) attributable to MPC was $(886) million, compared to $1.10 billion in the third quarter of 2019.

Step 3: The results show a significant decrease in net income, driven by losses in the Refining & Marketing segment and impairment charges related to COVID-19. The statement, "The loss from operations in our Refining & Marketing segment is primarily due to decreases in refined product sales volumes, prices, and margins during the current period," indicates a challenging quarter. Additionally, the restructuring expenses related to idling refineries further emphasize the difficulties faced.

Step 4: Taking into consideration the overall pessimistic sentiment, the significant losses in net income, impairment charges, and restructuring expenses, as well as the ongoing uncertainties related to the economic impacts of COVID-19, the company appears to have a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The financial challenges, coupled with the need to adapt to changing market conditions, contribute to the assessment of high risk.
