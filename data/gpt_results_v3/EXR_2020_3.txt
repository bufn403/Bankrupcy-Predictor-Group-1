Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While they highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business, they also mention measures taken to adapt to the situation. For example, they state, "Although the self-storage industry has historically been resilient to ordinary market downturns...the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and world economies generally, and on our future results in particular, could be significant." This shows a recognition of challenges but also a degree of resilience.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0057 indicates a slightly negative position in terms of liquidity and short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.0138 signifies a negative position in terms of utilizing assets for growth or paying off debts.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0477 shows a moderate return on assets, indicating some profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.0932 indicates a moderate level of revenue generation compared to total assets.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment of resilience in the face of challenges mentioned in the management's discussion with the financial ratios, it seems that the company is facing some financial strain but is still able to generate revenue and maintain profitability. The negative working capital and retained earnings ratios could be a concern, but the EBIT to Total Assets ratio shows a positive sign in terms of profitability.

Step 4: The company demonstrates a mix of positive and negative signals. While the financial ratios show some areas of concern, the management acknowledges the challenges and takes proactive measures to adapt. Therefore, based on the provided data and analysis, I would classify the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
