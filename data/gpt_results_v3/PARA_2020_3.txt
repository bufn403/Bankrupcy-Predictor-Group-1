Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment from the Management Discussion Text indicates a mixed outlook. While the impact of COVID-19 has negatively affected certain aspects of the business like advertising revenues and production shutdowns, the company has also benefited from increases in subscribers for streaming services and is actively working to mitigate revenue losses through cost-saving initiatives.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The value of 0.0569 suggests that the company has a relatively low level of working capital compared to its total assets, indicating some financial strain.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a value of 0.2583, the company's retained earnings as a proportion of total assets are at a moderate level.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): An EBIT to Total Assets ratio of -0.0062 indicates that the company is generating negative earnings before interest and taxes in relation to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.5538 shows that the company generates a moderate amount of revenue in comparison to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the sentiment analysis and financial ratios, it is evident that while the company is facing challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 on advertising revenues and production, there are also positive aspects such as subscriber growth in streaming services. The financial ratios indicate a somewhat strained financial position, especially with negative EBIT to Total Assets ratio, which may pose a risk.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, the company falls into the medium-risk category. The mixed outlook from the text, along with the financial ratios pointing towards some financial strain, suggests that while the company is actively managing the impacts of COVID-19, there are still risks to its financial stability. 

Overall, the company faces challenges due to the pandemic's impact on various revenue streams, but efforts to mitigate losses and the positive aspects like subscriber growth position it at a medium risk level for potential bankruptcy.
