Step 1: The sentiment from the management's discussion indicates a mixture of challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also efforts to adapt and maintain operations. The text mentions, "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and is likely to continue impacting Graingerâ€™s businesses and operations...Grainger is currently focused on remaining open and operational in order to serve customers and communities well through the pandemic." This shows a proactive approach to navigate the difficulties posed by the pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) ratio is 0.4226, indicating a moderate level of working capital relative to the total assets. It suggests that the company may have enough current assets to cover its current liabilities but not significantly high.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) ratio is 1.4928, showing that a relatively large portion of the total assets is financed by retained earnings. This indicates a strong equity position.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) ratio is 0.3183, which suggests that the company is generating a moderate amount of earnings relative to its total assets. 
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) ratio is 2.0226, indicating a high level of revenue generation compared to total assets.

Step 3: The financial ratios show a mixed picture. While the company has strong retained earnings and a good revenue to total assets ratio, the working capital to total assets ratio indicates a need for more liquidity management. The EBIT to total assets ratio shows that the company is generating earnings, but not at a very high level. The discussed challenges due to the pandemic have impacted various segments of the business differently, with some experiencing declines in sales volume.

Step 4: Taking into account the sentiment analysis, financial ratios, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financials, the assessment leans towards a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company has shown resilience in adapting to the pandemic challenges, but there are areas, such as working capital management, that require attention to mitigate risks effectively.
