Medium Risk

Step 1: The sentiment in the Management Discussion Text appears to be a mix of cautious optimism and acknowledgment of challenges. While there are mentions of cost management, revenue-generation opportunities, and maintaining client relationships, there are also clear indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial results and operations. The statement, "The Companyâ€™s financial results for the first three quarters of 2020 were affected by the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic" reflects the challenges faced.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The value of 0.3527 indicates that the company has a positive working capital, which is generally a good sign. However, a deeper analysis is needed in conjunction with other ratios.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The value of 0.0884 suggests that the proportion of retained earnings to total assets is relatively low, potentially indicating lower financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): With a value of 0.1543, this ratio shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets, indicating a moderate profitability level.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The high ratio of 2.1232 indicates that the company is generating significant revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: The company has faced challenges due to the global economic impact of the pandemic, resulting in a decrease in service revenues. The mention of reducing headcount and cost management efforts reflects the need to adapt to the changing business environment. The significant decrease in revenues from temporary and consultant staffing and permanent placement staffing indicates a slowdown in business activity. The positive growth in risk consulting and internal audit services is a bright spot in an otherwise challenging quarter.

Step 4: Considering the cautious tone in the Management Discussion Text, the mix of financial ratios pointing towards moderate financial stability, and the challenging operational environment, the company is assessed to have a Medium Risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company's ability to navigate through the ongoing economic uncertainties and adapt its operations will be crucial in determining its future financial health.
