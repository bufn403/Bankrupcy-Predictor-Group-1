Decision: Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and realistic about the impact of COVID-19 on their operations. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the pandemic but also highlights measures taken to address them.

Step 2: The company reported a net gain in the third quarter of 2020 but a net loss for the first nine months of the year due to substantial effects of financial market conditions. Liquidity was maintained with proactive steps taken to manage it, including refinancing and suspending share repurchases.

Step 3: The company anticipates adverse impacts on their operations due to COVID-19, particularly in their U.S. workplace solutions, individual solutions, and international businesses. They mention higher expenses and reduced sales prospects in the near term due to the pandemic's effects.

Reasoning: 
1. "For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020 we reported a net gain of $1,487 million and a net loss of $(1,193) million, respectively, as financial market conditions had a substantial effect on the reported results of our businesses." - Indicates the financial impact of market conditions on their operations.
2. "The impact of COVID-19 and related market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity and cause us to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, which could result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks." - Shows concerns about liquidity and potential impacts on credit ratings.
3. "We estimate that our net underwriting results will be adversely impacted by approximately $70 million for every incremental 100,000 fatalities in the U.S." - Displays the potential financial impact of COVID-19 on their underwriting results.

Overall, while the company has taken measures to manage the impacts of COVID-19, the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic's duration and intensity, along with the anticipated adverse effects on their operations, contribute to a medium risk classification for the company's future bankruptcy risk.
