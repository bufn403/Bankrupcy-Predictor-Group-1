Medium risk

Step 1: The tone of the management discussion is cautious due to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is mention of how the pandemic has impacted their operations and supply chain: "However, the disruptions in our outsourced assembly and test capacity that we experienced previously, as a result of COVID-19 related shutdowns, have now largely resolved." This cautious tone suggests potential challenges ahead.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio is 0.184, indicating that working capital is relatively low compared to total assets. A lower ratio could point to potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The ratio is 0.036, showing that a smaller portion of total assets is represented by retained earnings. This may suggest lower profitability and financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio is 0.229, indicating that earnings before interest and taxes are a moderate portion of total assets. A higher ratio would indicate better profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio is 0.492, suggesting that the company generates a significant amount of revenue compared to total assets.

Step 3: Combining the cautious tone of the management discussion with the financial ratios, it appears that while the company generates significant revenue, the lower working capital and retained earnings ratios indicate potential liquidity and profitability challenges. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations further adds to the uncertainty.

Step 4: Medium risk. Considering the cautious tone of the management discussion, along with the relatively low working capital and retained earnings to total assets ratios, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the financial metrics point to potential challenges in the company's financial stability.
