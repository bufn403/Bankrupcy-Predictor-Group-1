Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment from the management's discussion text is mostly optimistic. Management discusses the impact of COVID-19 and how they have adapted to the situation, stating, "With more people staying home, we have seen growth in our business and across the industry." This shows a level of adaptability and resilience.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0508 - This ratio indicates a relatively low working capital to total assets ratio, which may suggest some liquidity concerns.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.5466 - This ratio reflects a moderate level of retained earnings to total assets, indicating a stable financial position.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1028 - This ratio shows a positive EBIT margin, signifying profitability in relation to assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.5517 - This ratio indicates a high total revenue to total assets ratio, showing strong revenue generation capabilities.

Step 3: The company has shown adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in growth in their business. However, the low working capital to total assets ratio may pose liquidity concerns despite profitability and strong revenue generation. The moderate level of retained earnings provides some stability, but overall, there are mixed signals in terms of financial health. This quarter seems to have had both successes, such as growth in business, and challenges, like potential liquidity issues.

Step 4: Medium

In summary, the company's adaptability and revenue generation capabilities support a positive outlook, but the low working capital ratio and potential liquidity concerns suggest a need for financial management attention. This mixed financial performance indicates a medium risk of bankruptcy, with both strengths and areas needing improvement.
