We begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with a summary of business and macroeconomic developments followed by a summary of our overall business strategy to provide an overview of the goals and overall direction of our business.  This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  We then discuss our Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled "Liquidity and Capital Resources."
While strong customer demand for our products outpaced capacity in fiscal 2023, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates in the March 2023 quarter which continued in the June 2023 quarter.  Starting in early June 2023, we experienced unfavorable business conditions in our distribution channels in the China market, and we began to see signs of weakness and uncertainty in the automotive and industrial markets and economic weakness in Europe.  As a result, customer requests to push out or cancel backlog increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and we expect such requests to continue through calendar 2023.  Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment, we have paused most of our factory expansion activity and reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2025. In order to provide prioritized capacity to our customers, we launched our Preferred Supply Program in February 2021, which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning six months after the customer places an order for 12 months of continuous, non-cancellable and non-reschedulable backlog.  Although orders under our original program cannot be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer, in recent periods, we have accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages.  In response to industry capacity conditions improving and our product lead times reducing, we modified our Preferred Supply Program in August 2023 to allow customers to place orders for six months of continuous backlog rather than 12 months in the original program.  Preferred Supply Program orders placed during or after August 2023 can be cancelled or rescheduled if our planned delivery date is greater than six months from the request date.  Since the March 2022 quarter, we have been entering into long-term supply agreements (LTSAs) with certain of our customers for products that will be shipped in future periods.  We also entered into certain LTSAs with key suppliers.
We develop, manufacture and sell smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions used by our customers for a wide variety of applications.  Our strategic focus includes general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers, microprocessors, analog, FPGA, and memory products.  With over 30 years of technology leadership, our broad product portfolio is a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in their applications.  TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared to other solutions.  Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including 5G, data centers, sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and electric vehicles, in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers and computing, and industrial.Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test.  In fiscal 2023 we announced our intent to expand our production capacity in the U.S.  In particular, we have continued our multi-year $800 million capacity expansion plan at Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon and we plan to invest $880 million to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers at Fab 5 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin.  We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of Microsemi and other companies that outsourced all or substantial portions of their manufacturing.We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products.  We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs.  While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both mixed-signal microcontroller and non-volatile memory products.  This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new mixed-signal microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, FPGAs, timing systems, Flash-IP, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries.  We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products. We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors.  Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets.  We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.  Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for our sales team.  ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts.  Our licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees.See the risk factor captioned "Our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry" on page 41 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.
There were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the first three months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 compared to our "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" as previously described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.
The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the periods covered by this report:
We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies.  We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral.  In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.The following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended June 30,20232022ChangeNet sales$2,288.6 $1,963.6 16.6 %The increase in net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to our ability to satisfy our backlog of customer orders as more capacity became available.  In the second half of fiscal 2023 there began to be some increased uncertainty as to the future direction of the global economy due to rising interest rates and high inflation.  Additionally, semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain, which we have been generally passing on to our customers in the form of price increases.  Our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2023 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products.  These price increases also contributed to the increase in net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product, geographic and customer mix, we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales.  Additionally, the increase in net sales was positively impacted by strength in all of our product lines.  Due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the changes other than the net demand fluctuations in the end market we serve.  See our "Business and Macroeconomic Environment" discussion above for further information on our business outlook.  Other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:•semiconductor industry conditions;•our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;•customers’ increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; and•increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products through our Total Systems Solutions.We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 or the three months ended June 30, 2022.    Net sales by product line for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions):
Our mixed-signal microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.  Mixed-signal microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.9% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to approximately 54.2% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2022.Net sales of our mixed-signal microcontroller products increased 22.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to strength in demand for our mixed-signal microcontroller products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.  However, the overall average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products.  We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our mixed-signal microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.
Our analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed-signal and timing products.  Our analog product line accounted for approximately 27.7% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to approximately 29.5% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2022.Net sales from our analog product line increased 9.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases.We consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our mixed-signal microcontroller products.  The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products.
Our other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications.  Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 15.4% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to approximately 16.3% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net sales related to these services and products increased 10.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our products in end markets that we serve and our price increases.  Net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).
Distributors accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and approximately 47% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 11% of our net sales, no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 or in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of certain orders placed under our original Preferred Supply Program or otherwise designated as non-cancellable.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.At June 30, 2023, our distributors maintained 29 days of inventory of our products compared to 24 days at March 31, 2023.  Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 40 days.  Inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales.
Sales by geography for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions):
Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America.  Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 76% of our total net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to approximately 78% of our total net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Although our net sales in all geographies increased in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, net sales in Asia decreased as a percentage of total net sales primarily due to economic weakness in the China market caused by uncertain economic conditions, slowing growth, and the impact of COVID-19 related lockdowns.  Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated.  Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia.
Our gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.56 billion, or 68.1% of net sales, compared to $1.31 billion, or 66.7% of net sales, in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The primary reason for the increase in gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was the net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit of $266.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023.  The net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit may fluctuate over time due to the mix of sales volumes of lower or higher margin products, changes in selling prices, and fluctuations in product costs.  We are not able to separately quantify these impacts on our gross profit.  The net impact to our gross profit of inventory reserve charges was $21.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 which adversely impacted our gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The gross margin impact of changes in licensing revenue, which has no associated cost of sales, and the impact of unabsorbed capacity charges in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was not material.Our overall inventory levels were $1.34 billion at June 30, 2023, compared to $1.32 billion at March 31, 2023.  We maintained 167 days of inventory on our balance sheet at June 30, 2023 compared to 169 days of inventory at March 31, 2023.  Our inventory was relatively flat as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels including accommodating requests from certain customers to push-out orders.  Our inventory levels are impacted by the timing of receipt of raw materials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of finished goods.We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world.  Approximately 58% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities during each of the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.  During the three months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 69% of our test requirements were performed in our internal facilities compared to 62% during the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities.  We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to third-party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process.  We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements.  Approximately 66% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 63% during the three months ended June 30, 2022.  These percentages may vary from quarter to quarter based on supply and demand conditions in the market.We anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall product mix of mixed-signal microcontroller, analog, FPGA products, memory products, and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve.  We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.
R&D expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $298.5 million, or 13.0% of net sales, compared to $269.0 million, or 13.7% of net sales, for the three months ended June 30, 2022.  We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  R&D costs are expensed as incurred.  Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives.  R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.R&D expenses increased $29.5 million, or 11.0%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 over the same period last year.  The primary reasons for the increase in R&D expenses were increases in headcount and employee compensation as well as higher product development costs. R&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $203.6 million, or 8.9% of net sales, compared to $188.9 million, or 9.6% of net sales, for the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $14.7 million, or 7.8%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 over the same period last year.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in headcount and employee compensation.Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $151.5 million, compared to $167.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous fiscal years.
During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred special charges and other, net of $1.7 million, primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency.  During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we earned special income and other, net of $16.9 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of a previously accrued legal matter.
Interest expense in the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $47.2 million compared to $50.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022.  The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period last year was the cumulative pay down of our debt partially offset by higher interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized losses of $9.1 million related to the settlement of approximately $5.6 million in principal amount of our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, approximately $25.9 million in principal amount of our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and the outstanding principal amount of $6.5 million of our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt.  During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized losses of $6.2 million related to the settlement of approximately $31.0 million in principal amount of our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and approximately $3.6 million in principal amount of our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt.
Our provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes.  A comparison of our tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 is not meaningful due to the amount of pre-tax income, and income tax expense recorded during the prior period.We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations.  The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate.  Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was approximately 22%.  Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were lower than this amount.  The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors.  Our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.Our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in Malta taxed at a 5.0% statutory tax rate and Ireland taxed at a 12.5% statutory tax rate.  Additionally, our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant, and equipment in Thailand.  Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20.0%.  We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.In September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012.  The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters.  In December 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the Notice.  In May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for fiscal 2020, which if upheld by the highest court that has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, could result in income taxes up to $420.0 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.  The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets.  Depending on the outcome of the IRB audit, we may need to take the matter to court in Malaysia, and if we do, we may be required to pay the assessment and then request a refund from the court upon a series of favorable rulings.  The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could commence in the next 12 months. We firmly believe that the assessments described above are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve these matters.  We intend to vigorously defend our positions and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits.  We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as these to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves.  We believe that the final adjudication of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations or cash flows.  However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS and IRB were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses.  Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities.  We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions.  At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be.  We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law.  If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized.  If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act into law.  The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) of 15.0% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period, as well as a 1% excise tax on the net fair market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.  The Corporate AMT is effective in fiscal 2024.  Based on currently enacted tax laws, we do not expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact upon our tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate.
We had $271.2 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2023, an increase of $37.2 million from the March 31, 2023 balance.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $993.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to higher net income of $666.4 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $304.7 million and net cash inflows of $22.1 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in the three months ended June 30, 2023 include an increase in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by higher net sales and an increase in inventories related to increased raw materials, foundry wafers, finished goods, receipt of strategic last time buy materials, and accommodating requests from certain customers to push-out orders, offset by increases in accrued and other liabilities driven by higher deferred revenue and sales related reserves, including cash collected from customers under our LTSAs, and an increase in income tax payable.  The cash collected from these LTSAs is refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments.  In future periods, we expect cash inflows under these LTSAs to decrease, and cash outflows to increase as amounts are refunded to customers (see "Note 3. Net Sales" to our condensed consolidated financial statements).  Net cash provided by operating activities was $840.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to net income of $507.2 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $385.4 million and net cash outflows of $52.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $140.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $153.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, net investing activities primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets. Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.  Capital expenditures in the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $111.1 million compared to $121.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment.  Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment in the June 2023 quarter, we have paused most of our factory expansion actions and reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2025.  We currently intend to invest between $300 million and $350 million in equipment and facilities during the next 12 months.  We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.  We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.  In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our SiC and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility.  In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act which is to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry.  We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and expect to apply for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position.  If we do receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs.
Net cash used in financing activities was $815.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $626.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022.  Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows included:•in the first three months of fiscal 2024, $465.1 million of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, our 4.333% 2023 Notes, and our Revolving Credit Facility, and•in the first three months of fiscal 2023, $272.5 million of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and our Revolving Credit Facility, and•in the first three months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $208.9 million and $153.0 million, respectively, and•in the first three months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $140.3 million and $195.2 million, respectively. In December 2021, we amended and restated our Credit Agreement in its entirety.  The amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility up to $2.75 billion that terminates on December 16, 2026.  The Credit Agreement also permits us, subject to certain conditions, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase the revolving loan commitments up to $750.0 million.  As of June 30, 2023, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $6.05 billion.  At June 30, 2023, we had $725.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility compared to $100.0 million at March 31, 2023.  Our 2.670% 2023 Notes mature on September 1, 2023, and we intend to finance the repayment of such notes using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  In the first three months of fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $140.3 million under this authorization.  In the first three months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $195.2 million under this authorization.  As of June 30, 2023, approximately $2.49 billion remained available for repurchases under the program.  As of June 30, 2023, we held approximately 33.5 million shares as treasury shares.  Our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.In October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $5.95 billion.  A quarterly cash dividend of $0.383 per share was paid on June 5, 2023 in the aggregate amount of $208.9 million.  A quarterly dividend of $0.410 per share was declared on August 3, 2023 and will be paid on September 5, 2023 to stockholders of record as of August 22, 2023.  We expect the aggregate cash dividend for the September 2023 quarter to be approximately $223.0 million.  Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments.  For additional information regarding our cash requirements see "Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies", "Note 5. Debt" and "Note 10. Income Taxes" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and to expand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities.  We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to refinance our existing debt, maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.  The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the maturity dates of our existing debt, our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  We plan to refinance certain of our existing notes as they mature and we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our other outstanding debt or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, term loans, commercial paper, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases.  Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors.  There can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from rising interest rates, higher inflation, economic uncertainty, instability in the banking sector, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.  We also plan to pursue incentives under the CHIPS Act to increase our domestic manufacturing capacity; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives or what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be.
