Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems to be optimistic. They focus on how their decision management technology helps businesses in various industries and how their revenue has increased. 
Quote: "We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise... Revenue increased 5% to $312.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2020..."

Step 2: The company's revenue increased, particularly in their Scores segment, which is a positive sign. However, there was a decrease in revenue in their Applications segment due to a change in revenue recognition. 
Quote: "Scores revenue increased 26%... For our Applications and Decision Management Software segments, revenue decreased 9%..."

Step 3: Despite some decrease in revenue in certain segments, the company's operating income and net income increased, showing improvements. They also closed less strategic areas of their business to focus on more profitable ones. 
Quote: "Operating income increased 83%... We continue to advance our cloud-enabled, platform-based software strategy by exiting less strategic areas of our business..."

Conclusion: Considering the revenue growth in the Scores segment, the increase in operating income and net income, and the strategic decisions made by the company, they are deemed to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite some revenue decreases and uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall financial performance and strategic actions indicate a moderate risk level for bankruptcy.
