Medium risk

Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion appears cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on business activities and supply chain disruptions. They have taken steps to address the pandemic's effects, but uncertainty remains.

Step 2: The company experienced a decrease in product revenue due to reduced sales to larger customers and COVID-19 related supply constraints. Service revenue increased, but international revenues fluctuated based on deployments by large customers. Competitive pricing pressure is also mentioned.

Step 3: Gross margin remained consistent but was unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related supply chain costs. Research and development expenses increased slightly, and sales and marketing expenses were prudently managed on targeted investments. General and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition-related expenses.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, decrease in product revenue, unfavorable impact on gross margin, and increase in expenses, the company faces medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's impact on future business activity contributes to the risk level.
