High Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is quite pessimistic due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil and gas industry. The management acknowledges the significant disruption in demand for oil and related products, along with the uncertainty about the long-term impact on global oil demand.

Step 2: The company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to net income in the same period in 2019. This loss can be attributed to several factors such as a decrease in oil and gas revenues, net derivative results, net sales of purchased oil and gas, and an increase in other expenses.

Step 3: The decrease in average daily sales volumes, decrease in cash provided by operating activities, and the increase in net debt to book capitalization are all indicators of a failed quarter. The company's cost-saving initiatives and financial restructuring seem to be reactive measures to cope with the challenging economic environment.

Step 4: Considering the combination of a pessimistic sentiment, a failed quarter, and uncertain future conditions, such as the continued impact of the pandemic and market disruptions, along with the high level of debt and ongoing cost-saving measures, the company appears to be at high risk of bankruptcy in the future. These factors point towards significant financial distress and may hinder the company's ability to sustain its operations and meet its financial obligations.
