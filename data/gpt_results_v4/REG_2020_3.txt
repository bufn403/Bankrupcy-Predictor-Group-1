- Property development slowdown: The pause or significant slowdown in in-process development projects due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests operational disruptions and potential delays in revenue generation.

Step 3: The text reveals a decline in rental collections, occupancy rates, and revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in financial challenges for the company. The uncertainty surrounding the future performance of in-process development projects further adds to the operational risks faced by the company.
