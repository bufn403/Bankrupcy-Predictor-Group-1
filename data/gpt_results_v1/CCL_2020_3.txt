Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and pessimistic. They highlight significant impacts from COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding their operations due to the pandemic. This caution is exemplified by statements like, "The partial pause in guest operations is continuing to have material negative impacts on all aspects of our business" and "The longer the partial pause in guest operations continues, the greater the impact on our liquidity and financial position."

Step 2: The company's future projections indicate challenges and uncertainties ahead. They mention a significant decline in demand for cruises due to world events affecting travel, potential compliance issues with debt facilities due to COVID-19, and the anticipated slow development of certain geographical regions for business expansion. These factors are exemplified by statements such as, "World events impacting the ability or desire of people to travel may lead to a decline in demand for cruises" and "Geographic regions in which we try to expand our business may be slow to develop or ultimately not develop how we expect."

Step 3: The current financial state is challenging, with the company experiencing operating losses and significantly reduced revenues due to the pause in guest operations. They have taken actions to preserve cash and secure additional financing to increase liquidity. The company acknowledges the negative impacts on their business and the need for continued efforts to reduce expenses. This is supported by statements like, "As a result of the pause in our guest cruise operations, we have experienced essentially no revenue for the three months ended and meaningfully lower revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2020."

Based on the cautious sentiment, challenging future projections, and current financial difficulties outlined in the filing, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties surrounding the resumption of operations, declining demand, liquidity challenges, and significant losses contribute to this assessment.
