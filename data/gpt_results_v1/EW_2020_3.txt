Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While they acknowledge the adverse impact of COVID-19 on their business, they also highlight efforts to manage the situation and the positive aspects of their product launches and sales growth.

Step 2: The net sales for the first nine months of 2020 increased by $20.7 million compared to the same period in 2019, with sales growth in their TAVR products driving the increase. However, they also mention that sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Step 3: While the company experienced a drop in procedure volumes for some products due to COVID-19, they mention that volumes began to improve in the second and third quarters of 2020. They also resumed patient enrollment in clinical trials and saw positive trends in sales, especially for certain innovative products.

Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the lingering uncertainties and potential continued adverse effects on their financial condition suggest they are at high risk.
