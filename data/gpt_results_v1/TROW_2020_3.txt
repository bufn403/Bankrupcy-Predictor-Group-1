Step 1: Analyzing the sentiment of the management's discussion
The management's discussion seems optimistic overall. They mention positive returns in various markets, emphasize the importance of active management over passive investing in the long term, and highlight their capabilities, liquidity, and resources.

Step 2: Observing relevant numbers and figures
1. "Assets under management ended the third quarter of 2020 at $1,310.4 billion, an increase of $90.4 billion from June 30, 2020."
2. "Operating expenses were $866.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $767.6 million in the third quarter of 2019."
3. "Compensation and related costs were $552.3 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $86.0 million, or 18.4%, compared to the 2019 quarter."

Step 3: Determining the quarter's success and future outlook
1. The increase in assets under management is positive, reflecting growth.
2. The increase in operating expenses and compensation costs outpacing revenue growth could be a concern, especially the significant 18.4% increase in compensation costs.
3. While the company mentions investments for future growth, the notable rise in expenses raises questions about their cost management strategies.

Based on the discussion highlighting positive aspects but also revealing increased expenses, especially in compensation, relative to revenue growth, and the need for continuous fee waivers to maintain investor yield, the company exhibits a medium risk of bankruptcy. The increased expenses without proportional revenue growth could potentially impact their financial stability in the long run.
