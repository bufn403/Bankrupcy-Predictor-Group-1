Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic but highlight strong demand for their products after implementing various measures to adapt to the crisis.

They saw improvements in transaction counts as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits reached consumers.
