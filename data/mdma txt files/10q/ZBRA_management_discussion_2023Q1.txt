Zebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or the “Company”) is a global leader respected for innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based software subscriptions, that capture and move data. These products and solutions include mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device (“RFID”) readers; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; fixed industrial scanning and machine vision; real-time location systems (“RTLS”); related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and related software applications. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services, as well as various workflow optimization solutions, including cloud-based software subscriptions and robotic automation solutions. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and other industries within the following regions: North America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Asia-Pacific; and Latin America.Our customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve asset efficiency and utilization. The Company is poised to drive, and capitalize on, the evolution of the data capture industry into the broader EAI industry, supported by technology trends including the Internet of Things (“IoT”), ubiquitous mobility, automation, cloud computing, and the increasingly on-demand global economy. EAI solutions offer additional benefits to our customers including real-time, data-driven insights that improve operational visibility and drive workflow optimization.The Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). •The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels and services.•The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, workflow optimization solutions and location solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions. We are a market leader in our core businesses, which are generally considered to be comprised of our mobile computing and data capture products, printing products and supplies, as well as support and repair services. We continue to focus on growth opportunities within adjacent and expansion markets by scaling and integrating our recent business acquisitions, inclusive of our $881 million acquisition of Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. (“Matrox”) in the second quarter of 2022.
•Net sales were $1,405 million in the current year compared to $1,432 million in the prior year.•Operating income was $225 million in the current year compared to $212 million in the prior year.•Net income was $150 million, or $2.90 per diluted share in the current year, compared to Net income of $205 million, or $3.83 per diluted share in the prior year.•Net cash used in operating activities was $76 million in the current year compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $54 million in the prior year.The impacts of global cost inflation, rising interest rates, and a stronger U.S. dollar have continued in the current year; we believe these factors have contributed to a continued elongation of the sales cycle for large order deployments as well as moderating demand. As our overall supply chain continues to recover, with improvements in both component part availability and costs of transportation, our ability to meet customer demand has improved as compared to the prior year. We believe these trends will continue in the current year to varying degrees. We have, and expect to continue to, partially mitigate the financial impacts of operating headwinds through a combination of targeted list price increases, operating cost management, as well as our ongoing foreign currency exchange and interest rate management.In the third quarter of 2022, the Company committed to certain organizational changes and leased site rationalizations designed to generate structural cost efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2022 Productivity Plan”). The total cost under the initial scope of the 2022 Productivity Plan, which is expected to be completed in 2023, is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Total Exit and restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan to date were $22 million with $10 million recorded for the three months ended April 1, 2023.In the first quarter of 2022, we announced the suspension of our business operations in Russia. Neither Russia nor Ukraine comprises a material portion of our business; therefore, the war thus far has not had a significant effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the war has not significantly affected our ability to source supplies or deliver our products and services to our customers in the surrounding EMEA region. We will continue to monitor this for potential future adverse impacts on our business.
Net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages):
Operating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages):
Consolidated Organic Net sales growth:
(1)Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.(2)For purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions.(3)Consolidated Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.
Total Net sales decreased $27 million or 1.9% compared to the prior year as growth in our AIT segment was more than offset by a decline in our EVM segment. While our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows, current year Net sales within our EVM segment were negatively impacted by fewer large order deployments. Prior year Net sales of both segments were negatively impacted by supply chain bottlenecks, which were particularly pronounced in our AIT segment.  Excluding the effects of currency changes and acquisitions, the decrease in Consolidated Organic Net sales was 0.3%. Gross margin increased to 47.5% for the current year compared to 44.5% for the prior year.  Gross margin was higher in our AIT segment, while gross margin of our EVM segment was unchanged from the prior year. Both segments, particularly AIT, benefited from lower premium freight and component part costs compared to the prior year.Operating expenses for the quarters ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 were $442 million and $425 million, or 31.5% and 29.7% of Net sales, respectively. The increase in Operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to higher Exit and restructuring costs and the inclusion of operating expenses associated with recently acquired businesses, which were partially offset by lower Amortization of intangible assets.Operating income increased 6.1% to $225 million for the current year compared to $212 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit, which was partially offset by higher Operating expenses.Net income decreased 26.8% compared to the prior year due to increased Other (expense), net, and a higher effective income tax rate, which were partially offset by higher Operating income.•Other (expense) income, net was an expense of $40 million for the current year, compared to income of $38 million in the prior year primarily due to the current year including a $7 million loss on interest rate swaps versus a $34 million gain in the prior year as well as higher interest expense due to higher average outstanding debt levels and interest rates in the current year.•The Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 were 18.9% and 18.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate that became effective in the current year, partially offset by changes in the global mix of pretax earnings.Diluted earnings per share decreased to $2.90 as compared to $3.83 in the prior year due to lower Net income, partially offset by lower average shares outstanding.
The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reportable business segment as detailed in Note 17, Segment Information & Geographic Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs.
AIT Organic Net sales growth:
(1)Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.(2)AIT Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.
Total Net sales for AIT increased $97 million or 24.6% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of printing products across all regions. Current year Net sales included the benefit of targeted list price increases, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency changes. Prior year Net sales included the negative effects of supply chain bottlenecks. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net sales increased by 28.4%.Gross margin increased to 49.3% in the current year compared to 39.1% for the prior year primarily due to lower premium freight and component part costs, volume leverage and favorable business mix, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency changes.Operating income increased 120.0% in the current year compared to the prior year due to higher Gross profit, partially offset by higher Operating expenses.
EVM Organic Net sales growth:
(1)Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.(2)For purposes of computing EVM Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions.(3)EVM Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.
Total Net sales for EVM decreased $124 million or 11.9% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of mobile computing products largely attributed to fewer large order deployments, and unfavorable currency changes, which were partially offset by higher sales of data capture products, contributions from our recent acquisitions, targeted list price increases, and higher sales of services and software. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, EVM Organic Net sales decline was 11.2%.Gross margin was 46.5% in both the current and prior year. The benefits of lower premium freight and component part costs in the current year were offset by the negative impact of foreign currency changes.Operating income for the current year decreased by 31.2% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower Gross profit.
The primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions):
The change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the three months ended April 1, 2023 compared to the prior year is reflective of the following:•$130 million operating activity outflow primarily due to higher cash payments for inventory purchases, income taxes and interest along with the current year Settlement payment, partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections and lower employee incentive compensation payments.•$290 million financing activity inflow primarily due to lower common stock repurchases in the current year.
The following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):
The principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in March 2024 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company may make prepayments, as it did in the current period, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of April 1, 2023, the Term Loan A interest rate was 5.91%. Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.
The Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had letters of credit totaling $7 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1,500 million to $1,493 million. As of April 1, 2023, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 5.90%. Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 25, 2027.
The Company has two Receivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $280 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings. The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $180 million and matures on March 19, 2024. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $100 million and matures on May 15, 2023.  As of April 1, 2023, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $632 million of receivables that were pledged under the two Receivables Financing Facilities. As of April 1, 2023, $204 million had been borrowed and was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of April 1, 2023, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of 5.75%. Interest is paid monthly on these borrowings.
The Company has Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash. One arrangement allows for the factoring of up to $25 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region. The second arrangement allows for the factoring of up to €150 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were a total of $52 million and $61 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.As servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $138 million and $130 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
On May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. This authorization augments the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization which was announced on July 30, 2019. The newly authorized share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. The level of the Company’s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the first three months of 2023, the Company repurchased 55,811 shares of common stock for approximately $15 million. As of April 1, 2023, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 3,379,094 shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the plans of $930 million.
