Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and markets. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the pandemic but also highlights efforts to support clinicians and maintain technology supply.
Quote: "The global pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners."
Step 2: Despite facing challenges, the company managed to achieve an increase in net sales and gross profit. This increase was primarily driven by sales growth of TAVR products and cost-saving measures due to the pandemic.
Quote: "Our net sales for the first nine months of 2020 were $3.2 billion, representing an increase of $20.7 million over the first nine months of 2019."
Step 3: The company saw a drop in sales of certain products due to COVID-19 but also noted a rebound in procedure volumes late in the second quarter of 2020. Sales of specific products like the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra System continued to be positive.
Quote: "Our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our procedure volumes dropped significantly beginning in March 2020 due to COVID-19, and began to steadily improve beginning in May 2020."
Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, successful sales growth despite challenges, and a rebound in procedure volumes, the company appears to be managing well in the current circumstances. The increase in sales and gross profit indicate resilience, leading to a medium risk of bankruptcy, given the ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic.
Overall, the company exhibits a medium risk of bankruptcy due to the impacts of COVID-19 on its business operations, but also shows resilience in maintaining sales and gross profit growth during challenging times.
