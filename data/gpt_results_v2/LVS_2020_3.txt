Risk Level: High

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic as they repeatedly highlight the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations. For example, they mention, "Our financial results were adversely impacted by decreased visitation at our properties due to the COVID-19 Pandemic" and "Our net revenues decreased across our jurisdictions and properties due to the COVID-19 Pandemic."

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion support a failed quarter. The filing states, "Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2020, decreased 82.0%" and "Operating loss was $610 million compared to operating income of $899 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019."

Step 3: The conditions are likely to worsen as stated in the filing, "We have maintained our staffing levels across our jurisdictions through significantly reduced visitation" and "Operating margins in each business segment were negatively impacted due to employee and other costs incurred during this period of decreased visitation and property closures."

Step 4: The company has a high risk of bankruptcy based on the pessimistic sentiment, failed quarter, and the expectation of worsening conditions. Despite having a strong balance sheet and liquidity, the continuous impact of the pandemic, reduced revenues, and increased expenses indicate a challenging financial future for the company.

Therefore, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy.
