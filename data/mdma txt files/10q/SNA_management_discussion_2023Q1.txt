Snap-on cautions the reader that any forward-looking statements included in this document that are based upon assumptions and estimates were developed by management in good faith and are subject to risks, uncertainties or other factors that could cause (and in some cases have caused) actual results to differ materially from those described in any such statement. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results or regarded as a representation by the company or its management that the projected results will be achieved. For those forward-looking statements, Snap-on cautions the reader that numerous important factors, such as those listed below, the factors discussed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 year end”), and those discussed in this document, could affect the company’s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, Snap-on.Risks and uncertainties include, without limitation:•Uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally;•The timing and progress with which Snap-on can attain value through its Snap-on Value Creation Processes, including its ability to (i) realize efficiencies and savings from its rapid continuous improvement and other cost reduction initiatives, (ii) improve workforce productivity, (iii) achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing footprint and greater efficiencies in its supply chain, and (iv) enhance machine maintenance, plant productivity and manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, any or all of which could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs and/or lost revenues;•Snap-on’s capability to successfully implement future strategies with respect to its existing businesses;•Snap-on’s ability to refine its brand and franchise strategies, retain and attract franchisees, and further enhance service and value to franchisees in order to help improve the sales and profitability of franchisees;•The company’s ability to introduce successful new products;•Significant changes in the current competitive environment;•Risks related to pursuing, completing and integrating acquisitions;•Inflation, interest rate changes and other monetary and market fluctuations;•Price and supply fluctuations related to raw materials, components and certain purchased finished goods, such as steel, plastics, and electronics;•The effects of external economic factors, including adverse developments in world financial markets, disruptions related to tariffs and other trade issues, and global supply chain inefficiencies, including as a result of the current war in Ukraine;•Snap-on’s ability to successfully manage changes in prices and the availability of energy sources, including gasoline;•Snap-on’s ability to withstand disruption arising from natural disasters, including climate-related events or other unusual occurrences;•Risks associated with data security and technological systems and protections, including the effects of cyber incidents and from new legislation, regulations or government-related developments;•The impact of labor interruptions or challenges, and Snap-on’s ability to effectively manage human capital resources; •Snap-on’s ability to successfully manage planned facility closures or to withstand disruptions from unexpected closures;•Weakness in certain geographic areas, including as a result of localized recessions, and the impact of matters related to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union;•Changes in tax rates, laws and regulations as well as uncertainty surrounding potential changes;•The amount, rate and growth of health care and postretirement costs, including continuing and potentially increasing required contributions to pension and postretirement plans;
•The effects of new requirements, legislation, regulations or government-related developments or issues, as well as third party actions, including those addressing climate change;•Potential reputational damages and costs related to litigation;•The impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and other outbreaks of infectious diseases, as well as the effects of governmental actions related thereto on Snap-on’s business, which could have the potential to amplify the impact of the other risks facing the company; and•Other world or local events outside Snap-on’s control, including terrorist disruptions, armed conflicts and civil unrest.Snap-on disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document, except as required by law.In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) prescribe when a company should reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a major contingency. Reported results, therefore, may appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.
References in this report to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.
Results of operations for the three months ended April 1, 2023, and April 2, 2022, are as follows:
Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below “Operating earnings from financial services” are calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.Net sales of $1,183.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $85.2 million, or 7.8%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $109.2 million, or 10.2%, organic gain, partially offset by $24.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  Gross profit of $589.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $55.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to $534.3 million last year. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) of 49.8% in the quarter improved 110 basis points (100 basis points (“bps”) equals 1.0 percent) from the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, and benefits from the company’s “Rapid Continuous Improvement” or “RCI” initiatives, partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs and 20 bps of unfavorable foreign currency. Snap-on’s RCI initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations. Savings from Snap-on’s RCI initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency, productivity and process improvements, including savings generated from product design cost reductions, improved manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, lower-cost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations. Unless individually significant, it is not practicable to disclose each RCI activity that generated savings and/or segregate RCI savings embedded in sales volume increases.Operating expenses of $329.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $311.2 million last year.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.8% improved 60 bps from last year primarily due to the higher sales volumes.Operating earnings before financial services of $259.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $36.7 million, or 16.5%, compared to $223.1 million in the first quarter of 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings before financial services of 22.0% compared to 20.3% last year.Financial services revenue of $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $87.7 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.3 million in the period compared to $70.4 million in 2022.
Operating earnings of $326.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $32.6 million, or 11.1%, compared to $293.5 million last year.  As a percentage of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), operating earnings of 25.6% in the quarter compared to 24.8% last year.Interest expense in the first quarter of 2023 increased $0.8 million compared to last year. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap-on’s debt and credit facilities.Other income (expense) – net primarily includes net gains and losses associated with hedging and currency exchange rate transactions, non-service components of net periodic benefit costs, and interest income. See Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Other income (expense) – net.Snap-on’s effective income tax rate on earnings attributable to Snap-on was 23.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and 23.7% in the first quarter of 2022.  See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes.Net earnings attributable to Snap-on in the first quarter of 2023 of $248.7 million, or $4.60 per diluted share, increased $31.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, as compared to $217.4 million, or $4.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022.
Snap-on’s business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide, including customers in the aerospace, natural resources, government and military, power generation, transportation and technical education market segments (collectively, “critical industries”), primarily through direct and distributor channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s multi-national mobile tool distribution channel. The Repair Systems & Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers worldwide, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, through direct and distributor channels. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on’s finance subsidiaries.Snap-on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating earnings. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes and certain other assets. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap-on’s consolidated financial results.
Segment net sales of $363.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $23.7 million, or 7.0%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $36.2 million, or 11.1%, organic sales increase, partially offset by $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase primarily reflects double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment’s specialty tools business, as well as a low single-digit increase in the segment’s European-based hand tools business.
Segment gross margin in the first quarter of 38.8% improved 240 bps from last year, primarily due to higher sales volumes, including increased activity in higher gross margin critical industries, pricing actions, and benefits from the segment’s RCI initiatives.  These improvements were partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs.Segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 23.5% increased 50 bps as compared to 2022 primarily due to increased sales in higher-expense businesses.As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $55.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, including $2.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $10.1 million, or 22.1%, compared to $45.7 million in 2022. Operating margin (segment operating earnings as a percentage of segment net sales) for the Commercial & Industrial Group of 15.3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 13.4% in 2022.
Segment net sales of $537.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $24.9 million, or 4.9%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $32.0 million, or 6.3%, organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is due to a high single-digit gain in the U.S. franchise business and a low single-digit increase in the segment’s international operations.Segment gross margin in the first quarter of 47.3% improved 180 bps from last year primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs, and benefits from the segment’s RCI initiatives.  These improvements were partially offset by 80 bps of unfavorable foreign currency effects.Segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 22.8% was unchanged from last year.As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $131.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $15.7 million, or 13.5%, compared to $116.0 million in 2022. Operating margin for the Snap-on Tools Group of 24.5% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 22.7% last year.
Segment net sales of $446.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $48.4 million, or 12.2%, from 2022 levels, reflecting a $54.4 million, or 13.9%, organic sales increase, partially offset by $6.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in activity with OEM dealerships, and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Segment gross margin in the first quarter of 43.5% declined 110 bps from last year primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and the effects of higher material and other costs.  These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as 30 bps of favorable foreign currency effects.Segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 20.1% improved 150 bps from 2022 primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity in lower-expense businesses, and savings from RCI initiatives.As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $104.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, including $0.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $13.0 million, or 14.2%, from $91.6 million in 2022. Operating margin for the Repair Systems & Information Group of 23.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 23.0% last year.
Financial services revenue is generally dependent on the size of the average financial services portfolio during the period, as well as on the average yield on receivables. Financial services revenue in the first quarter of 2023 increased $4.9 million, or 5.6%, from $87.7 million last year. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yields on contract receivables were 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Originations of $300.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased $55.3 million, or 22.5%, from 2022 levels. Financial services expenses primarily include personnel-related and other general and administrative costs, as well as provisions for credit losses. These expenses are generally more dependent on changes in the size of the financial services portfolio than they are on the revenue of the segment. Financial services expenses in the first quarter of 2023 increased primarily due to higher provisions for credit losses as compared to those recorded in the first quarter of 2022. As a percentage of the average financial services portfolio, expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and 0.8% in 2022.Segment operating earnings in the first quarter of 2023, including $0.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $4.1 million, or 5.8%, from 2022 levels.
Snap-on’s first quarter 2023 general corporate expenses of $32.3 million increased $2.1 million from $30.2 million last year primarily due to higher stock-based and performance-based compensation.
The following non-GAAP supplemental data is presented for informational purposes to provide readers with insight into the information used by management for assessing the operating performance of Snap-on’s non-financial services (“Operations”) and “Financial Services” businesses.The supplemental Operations data reflects the results of operations and financial position of Snap-on’s tools, diagnostics, equipment products, software, and other non-financial services operations with Financial Services presented on the equity method. The supplemental Financial Services data reflects the results of operations and financial position of Snap-on’s U.S. and international financial services operations. The financing needs of Financial Services are met through intersegment borrowings and cash generated from Operations; Financial Services is charged interest expense on intersegment borrowings at market rates. Income taxes are charged to Financial Services on the basis of the specific tax attributes generated by the U.S. and international financial services businesses. Transactions between the Operations and Financial Services businesses were eliminated to arrive at the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Snap-on’s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise.Due to Snap-on’s credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. As of April 14, 2023, Snap-on’s long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, A2 and P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service; A- and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s; and A and F1 by Fitch Ratings. Snap-on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. However, Snap-on cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or that its debt ratings will not decrease.The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of April 1, 2023, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $2,482.2 million increased $84.9 million from $2,397.3 million as of December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022 year end), primarily as a result of the net changes discussed below.The following represents the company’s working capital position as of April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022:
Cash and cash equivalents of $833.8 million as of April 1, 2023, increased $76.6 million from 2022 year-end levels primarily due to: (i) $301.6 million of cash generated from operations; (ii) $207.5 million of cash from collections of finance receivables; (iii) $32.8 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises; and (iv) $0.8 million of net proceeds from other short-term borrowings. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by: (i) the funding of $257.1 million of new finance receivables; (ii) the repurchase of 356,000 shares of the company’s common stock for $87.2 million; (iii) dividend payments to shareholders of $86.1 million; and (iv) the funding of $23.0 million of capital expenditures.Of the $833.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of April 1, 2023, $267.9 million was held outside of the United States. Snap-on maintains non-U.S. funds in its foreign operations to: (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) generally eliminated U.S. federal taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, such dividends may still be subject to state income taxation and foreign withholding taxes. Snap-on periodically evaluates its cash held outside the United States and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner.
Trade and other accounts receivable – net of $782.4 million as of April 1, 2023, increased $20.7 million from 2022 year-end levels primarily due to higher sales and $3.7 million of foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable – net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months sales, times 360 days) was 62 days at April 1, 2023, and 61 days at December 31, 2022.The current portions of net finance and contract receivables of $677.9 million as of April 1, 2023, compared to $672.1 million at 2022 year end. The long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of $1,584.9 million as of April 1, 2023, compared to $1,554.6 million at 2022 year end. The combined $36.1 million increase in net current and long-term finance and contract receivables over 2022 year-end levels is primarily due to an increase in net receivable originations and $1.1 million of foreign currency translation. Inventories – net of $1,049.1 million as of April 1, 2023, increased $16.0 million from 2022 year-end levels primarily due to higher demand, increased costs, efforts to manage the current supply chain situation and $6.2 million of foreign currency translation. Inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 2.4 turns and 2.5 turns as of April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method approximated 61% of total inventories as of both April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022. All other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The company’s LIFO reserve was $108.9 million and $108.6 million as of April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.Notes payable of $18.2 million as of April 1, 2023, compared to $17.2 million as of 2022 year end.Accounts payable of $283.1 million as of April 1, 2023, decreased $3.9 million from 2022 year-end levels primarily due to the timing of payments, partially offset by $1.0 million of foreign currency translation.Other accrued liabilities of $491.3 million as of April 1, 2023, increased $54.9 million from 2022 year-end levels primarily due to higher tax accruals and $1.6 million of foreign currency translation.Long-term debt of $1,184.0 million as of April 1, 2023, consisted of: (i) $300 million of unsecured 3.25% notes that mature on March 1, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”); (ii) $400 million of unsecured 4.10% notes that mature on March 1, 2048 (the “2048 Notes”); and (iii) $500 million of 3.10% notes that mature on May 1, 2050 (“the 2050 Notes”), partially offset by $16.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.Snap-on has an $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on September 16, 2024 (the “Credit Facility”); no amounts were borrowed or outstanding under the Credit Facility for the three months ended and as of April 1, 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on either: (i) Snap-on’s then-current, long-term debt ratings; or (ii) Snap-on’s then-current ratio of consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments (“Consolidated Net Debt”) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended (the “Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio”). The Credit Facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of Consolidated Net Debt to the sum of Consolidated Net Debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (the “Leverage Ratio”); or (ii) a Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Snap-on may, up to two times during any five-year period during the term of the Credit Facility (including any extensions thereof), elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio to 0.65 to 1.00 and/or increase the maximum Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions (as defined in the related credit agreement). As of April 1, 2023, the company’s actual ratios of 0.08 and 0.30 respectively, were both within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant. Snap-on generally issues commercial paper to fund its financing needs on a short-term basis and uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support such commercial paper issuances. As of April 1, 2023, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.
Snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the Credit Facility. Snap-on believes that it can access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. Snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, if it believes conditions are favorable, it may take advantage of such conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on include payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $6.9 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.4 million to its domestic pension plans in 2023, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2023.Snap-on’s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations.The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $301.6 million and $193.9 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $107.7 million year-over-year increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects a $66.6 million change in net operating assets and liabilities and a $31.6 million increase in net earnings.
Net cash used by investing activities of $72.9 million in the first three months of 2023 included additions to finance receivables of $257.1 million, offset by collections of $207.5 million. Net cash used by investing activities of $6.6 million in the first three months of 2022 included additions to finance receivables of $205.5 million, offset by collections of $215.6 million. Finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees’ customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, with average payment terms of approximately four years.Capital expenditures were $23.0 million and $20.2 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures in both years included continued investments related to the company’s execution of its strategic Value Creation Processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI.
Net cash used by financing activities of $152.1 million in the first three months of 2023 included net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $0.8 million; net cash used by financing activities of $106.3 million in the first three months of 2022 included net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $2.3 million.  Proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises totaled $32.8 million and $5.8 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the first three months of 2023, Snap-on repurchased 356,000 shares of its common stock for $87.2 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. In the first three months of 2022, Snap-on repurchased 136,000 shares of its common stock for $28.8 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of April 1, 2023, Snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.4 million in common stock pursuant to its Board’s authorizations. The repurchase of Snap-on common stock to offset dilution related to equity plan issuances or for other corporate purposes is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap‑on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company’s additional share repurchases, if any.Snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends totaled $86.1 million and $75.7 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. On November 4, 2022, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14.1% to $1.62 per share ($6.48 per share annualized). Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends.
Snap-on’s discussion of its critical accounting policies and estimates, contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, have not materially changed since the report was filed.
We believe that our markets and our operations possess and have demonstrated continuing and considerable resilience against the uncertainties of the current environment.  In 2023, Snap-on expects to make ongoing progress along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, it is projected that capital expenditures in 2023 will approximate $100 million, of which $23.0 million was incurred in the first three months of the year.Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.
