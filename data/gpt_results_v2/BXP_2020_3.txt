Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and realistic about the challenges posed by the ongoing global pandemic. Despite highlighting strengths of the company, there is a clear acknowledgment of the negative impact on the economy and business operations.

Step 2: The discussion includes key figures such as rent collections, which were at 97% for the third quarter, with 99% from office tenants and 62% from retail tenants. It also mentions write-offs totaling approximately $10 million and cash rent abatements and deferrals amounting to $18.2 million.

Step 3: The company experienced declines in revenue from retail tenants, parking, and hotel operations due to the pandemic, with net operating income decreasing compared to the previous year. Despite signing leases and renewals, the uncertainty around future demand for office space is highlighted, impacting decision-making by existing and prospective tenants.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, the financial figures pointing to challenges in revenue generation, and uncertainties in the leasing market due to the pandemic, the company is at a medium risk of bankruptcy. The strong focus on tenant satisfaction, development projects, and maintaining a conservative balance sheet provides some assurance, but the overall impact of the current environment remains a significant concern for future financial performance.
