Decision: Medium 

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems to be a mix of challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lower sales volumes, as well as proactive measures taken to mitigate the impact. Despite the challenges, the company emphasizes its essential role in providing critical products and services during the pandemic, indicating a resilient approach to the situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio of 0.102 reflects a relatively low working capital position compared to total assets, which could indicate some liquidity strain.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The ratio of 0.268 shows that a significant portion of total assets is funded by retained earnings, indicating a stable financial foundation.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio of 0.103 indicates that the company's earnings before interest and taxes are relatively low concerning total assets, which could suggest lower profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.604 indicates that the company generates a moderate level of revenue concerning its total assets.

Step 3: By combining the financial ratios and the text analysis, we see a company that is grappling with the impact of the pandemic on its sales volumes and profitability. The restructuring program undertaken to reduce costs and gain efficiencies indicates a proactive approach to address the challenging market conditions. The company's essential role in providing critical products during the pandemic showcases its resilience. However, the lower profitability indicated by the EBIT to Total Assets ratio and the liquidity strain implied by the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio suggest a medium level of financial risk.

Step 4: The company exhibits a mix of resilience in the face of challenges and proactive measures to address the impact of the pandemic. However, the lower profitability and liquidity strain indicate a level of financial risk that positions the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
