The discussions in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” and “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” below include references to financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. See the tables in note (c) beginning on page 41 for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also in note (c), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page 47 for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Beginning on page 46, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information.
Our results for the first quarter of 2023 were favorably impacted by the continued strong worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels, while the worldwide supply of those products remained constrained. This supply and demand imbalance has continued to contribute to strong refining margins.The strong demand for our products and the increase in refining margins were the primary contributors to us reporting $3.1 billion of net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the first quarter of 2023. Our operating results, including operating results by segment, are described in the following summary under “First Quarter Results,” with more detailed descriptions found under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page 34.Our operations generated $3.2 billion of cash during the first quarter of 2023. This cash was used to make $524 million of capital investments in our business and return $1.8 billion to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments. In addition, we continued to reduce our outstanding debt through the purchase of approximately $199 million of our public debt during the first quarter of 2023. As a result of this and other activity, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $659 million, from $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 to $5.5 billion as of March 31, 2023. We had $10.8 billion in liquidity as of March 31, 2023. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources, can be found under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” beginning on page 44.
For the first quarter of 2023, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $3.1 billion compared to $905 million for the first quarter of 2022. The increase of $2.2 billion was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $2.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $628 million. The details of our operating income and adjusted operating income by segment and in total are reflected on the following page. Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustment reflected in the table in note (c) on page 43.
While our operating income increased by $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted operating income also increased by $2.7 billion primarily due to the following:•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $2.6 billion primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins, higher discounts on crude oils, and an increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense).•Renewable Diesel segment. Renewable Diesel segment operating income increased by $56 million primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower renewable diesel prices, higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), and higher depreciation and amortization expense.•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income increased by $37 million primarily due to higher corn related co-product prices and higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ethanol prices.
Many uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand imbalance in the petroleum-based products market worldwide. While it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its impact on product supply and demand, as well as any effect that the uncertainty described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements may have on us, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the second quarter of 2023.•Gasoline and diesel demand have returned to near pre-pandemic levels and are expected to follow typical seasonal patterns. Jet fuel demand continues to improve, but remains below pre-pandemic levels.•Light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories in the U.S. and Europe are below historical levels and should support continued high utilization of refining capacity.•Crude oil discounts have narrowed with reduced sour crude oil production from suppliers in OPEC+ but are expected to remain near current levels absent further changes in crude oil supply or availability.•Renewable diesel margins are expected to remain consistent with current levels.•Ethanol demand is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns.
The following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in note (c) beginning on page 41, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations. Note references in this section can be found on pages 41 through 43.
The following table includes selected financial data for the total company, corporate, and other for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables, unless otherwise noted.
Revenues decreased by $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to decreases in product prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels associated with sales made by our Refining segment. This decrease in revenues, along with an increase in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) of $39 million primarily due to an increase in certain employee compensation expenses, was more than offset by a decrease in cost of sales of $4.8 billion, which was primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs. These changes resulted in a $2.7 billion increase in operating income, from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to $4.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023.Adjusted operating income also increased by $2.7 billion, from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to $4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The components of this $2.7 billion increase in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analyses that follow.“Other income (expense), net” increased by $149 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to the items noted in the following table (in millions):
Income tax expense increased by $628 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily as a result of higher income before income tax expense.
The following table includes selected financial and operating data of our Refining segment for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables, unless otherwise noted.
Refining segment operating income increased by $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Refining segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustment in the table in note (c), also increased by $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The components of this increase in the adjusted results, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below.•Refining segment margin increased by $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.Refining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process. The table on page 36 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our Refining segment margin in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.The increase in Refining segment margin was primarily due to the following:◦An increase in distillate (primarily diesel) margins had a favorable impact of approximately $1.0 billion.◦Higher discounts on crude oils had a favorable impact of approximately $676 million.◦An increase in gasoline margins had a favorable impact of approximately $506 million.◦An increase in throughput volumes of 130,000 barrels per day had a favorable impact of approximately $262 million.•Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $68 million primarily due to increases in chemicals and catalyst costs of $50 million, certain employee compensation costs of $24 million, and maintenance expense of $19 million, partially offset by a decrease in energy costs of $50 million.
The following table includes selected financial and operating data of our Renewable Diesel segment for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables, unless otherwise noted.
Renewable Diesel segment operating income increased by $56 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below.•Renewable Diesel segment margin increased by $123 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Renewable Diesel segment margin is primarily affected by the price for the renewable diesel that we sell and the cost of the feedstocks that we process. The table on page 37 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our Renewable Diesel segment margin in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.The increase in Renewable Diesel segment margin was primarily due to the following:◦An increase in sales volumes of 1.3 million gallons per day had a favorable impact of approximately $259 million. The increase in sales volumes was primarily due to the additional production capacity resulting from the completion of the new DGD Port Arthur Plant that commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.◦Lower renewable diesel prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately $152 million.•Renewable Diesel segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $35 million primarily due to increased costs resulting from the new DGD Port Arthur Plant that commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.•Renewable Diesel segment depreciation and amortization expense increased by $32 million primarily due to depreciation expense of $16 million associated with the new DGD Port Arthur Plant that commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022, higher turnaround and catalyst amortization expense at the DGD St. Charles Plant of $8 million, and an increase in depreciation expense of $6 million associated with finance leases.
The following table includes selected financial and operating data of our Ethanol segment for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables, unless otherwise noted.
Ethanol segment operating income increased by $38 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022; however, Ethanol segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustment in the table in note (c), increased by $37 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher Ethanol segment margin.Ethanol segment margin increased by $32 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices for the ethanol and corn related co-products that we sell and the cost of corn that we process. The table on page 37 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our Ethanol segment margin in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.The increase in Ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following:•Higher prices for the co-products that we produce, primarily dry distillers grains, had a favorable impact of approximately $31 million.•An increase in production volumes of 138,000 gallons per day had a favorable impact of approximately $17 million.•Lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately $18 million.The following notes relate to references on pages 34 through 40.(a)“Other income (expense), net” includes the following:◦a net gain of $11 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to the early retirement of approximately $199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes; and ◦a charge of $50 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to the early retirement of approximately $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes. (b)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel.(c)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.Non-GAAP measures are as follows:◦Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
◦Renewable Diesel margin is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense, as reflected in the table below.
◦Ethanol margin is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
◦Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
◦Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
◦Adjusted operating income is defined as total company operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
(d)We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the Refining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments.
Our liquidity consisted of the following as of March 31, 2023 (in millions):
(a)Excludes the committed facilities of the consolidated VIEs.(b)The amount for our Canadian Revolver is shown in U.S. dollars. As set forth in the summary of our credit facilities in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the availability under our Canadian Revolver as of March 31, 2023 in Canadian dollars was C$145 million.(c)Excludes $118 million of cash and cash equivalents related to the consolidated VIEs that is for their use only.
We believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.
Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):
In the first quarter of 2023, we used the $3.2 billion of cash generated by our operations and the $914 million in debt borrowings to make $549 million of investments in our business, repay $1.2 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), return $1.8 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase our available cash on hand by $659 million. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.As previously noted, our operations generated $3.2 billion of cash in the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by net income of $3.1 billion and noncash charges to income of $558 million, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $534 million. Noncash charges primarily included $660 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $54 million of deferred income tax expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.Our investing activities of $549 million primarily consisted of $524 million in capital investments, as defined below under “Capital Investments,” of which $114 million related to capital investments made by DGD. Other financing activities of $74 million consisted primarily of $75 million in contributions from the other joint venture member in DGD.
In the first quarter of 2022, we used the $588 million of cash generated by our operations, $1.5 billion of cash on hand, and the $1.1 billion in debt issuances and borrowings to make $841 million of investments in our business, repay $1.9 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), and return $545 million to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments. The debt issuance, borrowings, and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.As previously noted, our operations generated $588 million of cash in the first quarter of 2022, driven primarily by net income of $967 million and noncash charges to income of $343 million, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $722 million. Noncash charges primarily included $606 million of depreciation and amortization expense and a $50 million loss on the early retirement of debt, partially offset by a $234 million deferred income tax benefit. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.Our investing activities of $841 million consisted of $843 million in capital investments, of which $225 million related to capital investments made by DGD and $13 million related to capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD.Other financing activities of $155 million consisted primarily of $165 million in contributions from the other joint venture member in DGD.
Our material cash requirements as of March 31, 2023 primarily consisted of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. Our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below.
Capital investments are comprised of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows as shown on page 5. Capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any.We have publicly announced GHG emissions reduction/displacement targets for 2025 and 2035. We believe that our expected allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects is consistent with such targets. Certain of these low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2023. Our capital investments in future years, consistent with our targets, are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval.
Capital investments attributable to Valero is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated VIEs.We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and consolidate its financial statements. As a result, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. See Note 6 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VIEs that we consolidate. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.Capital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.
We have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. As previously disclosed in our annual report on  Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments attributable to Valero during 2023. Approximately $1.5 billion of the expected capital investments attributable to Valero are for sustaining the business and the balance towards growth strategies, of which over 40 percent is allocated to expanding our low-carbon businesses.
As of March 31, 2023, our contractual obligations included debt obligations, interest payments related to debt obligations, operating lease liabilities, finance lease obligations, other long-term liabilities, and purchase obligations. In the ordinary course of business, we had debt-related activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations during the three months ended March 31, 2023.During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we used cash on hand to purchase and retire approximately $199 million of our public debt. We will continue to evaluate further deleveraging opportunities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we purchased for treasury 10,993,341 of our shares for $1.5 billion. See Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our stock purchase programs. As of March 31, 2023, we had $899 million remaining available for purchase under the October 2022 Program and $2.5 billion available for purchase under the 2023 Program. We will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.
As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we plan to contribute $108 million to our pension plans and $21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2023. No significant contributions were made during the three months ended March 31, 2023.
As of March 31, 2023, $4.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, U.S. state income taxes, and U.S. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us.
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG and other emissions, our refining and marketing facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase.
Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events causing volatility in the global crude oil markets. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
