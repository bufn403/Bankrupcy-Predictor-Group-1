Step 1: The management's discussion indicates that the company faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in temporary closures of their properties and a significant adverse impact on their business, financial condition, and results of operations. They mention paying full-time employees, implementing furloughs, and salary reductions to navigate through the crisis, indicating a challenging operational environment.

Step 2: 
- Impact of COVID-19: The temporary closure of properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the company's operations and financial results, leading to measures like furloughs, salary reductions, and the need to obtain waivers on financial covenants and capital expenditure requirements.
- Impairment Charges: The recognition of impairment charges related to goodwill and trade names in the Regional segment due to recent performance declines and expected future impacts on cash flows reveals financial strain.
- Divestitures: The company engaged in divestitures of various properties to raise capital or as part of regulatory approvals related to the Merger, indicating a shift in business focus and potential liquidity needs.

Step 3: The company experienced a mix of adverse events like the impact of COVID-19, impairments charges, and divestitures that have likely weakened their financial standing. These factors suggest a medium level of bankruptcy risk, as the company had to implement cost-saving measures and faced impairments due to operational challenges.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, impairment charges, and strategic divestitures have likely strained the company's financial health. While they have taken steps to adjust their operations and manage costs, the extent of the impact from these events indicates a moderate level of bankruptcy risk in the foreseeable future.
