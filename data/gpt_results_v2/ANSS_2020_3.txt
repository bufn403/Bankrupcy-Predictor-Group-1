Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the impact of COVID-19 but also highlighting resilience and ongoing investments in the business.

Quote: "We are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and continually assessing its current and potential effects on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is for the foreseeable future expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, employees, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows." 

Step 2: The company experienced an increase in revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, but also faced challenges due to the pandemic, particularly in perpetual license revenue and service revenue.

Quote: "The growth in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was due to growth in lease license revenue and maintenance revenue and contributions from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue and service revenue." 

Step 3: The company acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 on their revenue, particularly in perpetual licenses, but also highlights their diverse customer base and ability to conduct remote business as mitigating factors.

Quote: "The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 with the most pronounced reductions occurring in perpetual licenses. However, due to our diverse customer base, both from a vertical and geographic perspective, as well as the close relationships with customers, we were able to conduct a large amount of business remotely, which partially mitigated the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak." 

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the discussion, the impact of COVID-19 on revenue, and the company's efforts to adapt to the changing business environment, the company appears to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. While they show resilience and adaptability, the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic and potential economic uncertainty indicate a level of risk.

Overall assessment: Medium Risk.
