Decision: Medium

Step 1: The tone of the management discussion seems to focus on the challenges faced by PACCAR due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as indicated by statements such as "The Companyâ€™s financial results...were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic" and "Effects of the pandemic...included reduced truck deliveries, increased costs associated with suspension of production." This suggests a cautious and somewhat challenging outlook.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) of 0.4707: This indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital relative to its total assets, which could be indicative of some financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) of 0.3865: This ratio shows that the company retains a relatively high proportion of earnings compared to its total assets, which is generally positive for long-term financial health.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) of 0.1457: This ratio signifies that the company's earnings before interest and taxes make up about 14.57% of its total assets, which may indicate some operational efficiency challenges.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) of 0.8605: This ratio indicates that the company's total revenue is 86% of its total assets, showing a good utilization of assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: When combining the information from the text analysis with the financial ratios, it suggests that while the company is facing challenges due to the pandemic, it also shows signs of stability in terms of retained earnings and revenue generation. The financial ratios show a mixed picture of financial health, indicating some areas of strength but also potential areas of concern such as lower EBIT to Total Assets ratio.

Step 4: Considering the overall sentiment of caution in the management discussion and the mixed financial ratios, the company is more likely to face medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company seems to be navigating through the challenges posed by the pandemic while maintaining some level of financial stability. It's crucial for the company to address the operational efficiency challenges highlighted by the EBIT to Total Assets ratio to mitigate the risk further.
