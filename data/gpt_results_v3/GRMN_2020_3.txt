Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the cyber attack but highlights their mitigation efforts and positive trends in sales. This mixed sentiment indicates a balanced view of the current situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.3665 - This ratio indicates that the company has a relatively low level of working capital in relation to its total assets, which could signal potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.6118 - The high proportion of retained earnings to total assets suggests financial stability and profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1269 - The ratio of EBIT to total assets is relatively low, indicating that the company may not be generating significant earnings from its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.6077 - This ratio reflects a high level of revenue generation in relation to total assets, which is a positive sign for the company's performance.

Step 3: The financial ratios paint a mixed picture of the company's financial health. While the high Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio indicates stability, the low Working Capital to Total Assets and EBIT to Total Assets ratios suggest potential liquidity and profitability concerns. The Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio shows a strong revenue generation, which is positive. The company seems to be managing its operations well despite facing challenges.

Step 4: Overall, considering the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mixed financial ratios, and the challenging external factors like the pandemic and cyber attack, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's efforts to mitigate risks and the positive revenue trends provide some stability, but the liquidity and profitability concerns warrant attention. The company should continue to monitor and adjust its strategies for sustained financial health.
