Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge the challenges posed by the pandemic but also highlight their strong brands, diversified product portfolio, and favorable liquidity position, which they believe will position them for continued long-term growth.

Step 2: The company experienced an increase in total net sales primarily driven by higher sales in both wholesale and DTC channels for the UGG and HOKA brands. The increase in volume of pairs sold and net sales on a constant currency basis also indicates some level of success despite the challenges faced.

Step 3: Despite the overall increase in net sales, the company mentioned that they experienced lower international sales for the UGG brand due to marketplace reset strategies in Europe and Asia, and lower sales in certain regions. They also noted that the impacts of the pandemic may cause a lower growth rate of the HOKA brand in future periods.

Step 4: Considering the cautiously optimistic sentiment, increase in net sales, and challenges in certain regions highlighted by the company, the medium-risk classification is appropriate. The company has shown resilience and growth potential but also faces uncertainties and challenges that may impact their future performance.
