Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion leans more towards caution and uncertainty due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite not negatively impacting liquidity, the company acknowledges potential future challenges: "The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our future business operations, financial results and liquidity will depend on future developments, is highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted..."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value indicates potential financial strain as current liabilities exceed current assets, impacting short-term financial health negatively.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The positive value suggests a decent proportion of retained earnings relative to total assets, which is a positive indicator for financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The positive value implies that earnings before interest and taxes are generating a reasonable return concerning total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The moderate value indicates that the company is generating revenue relative to its total assets, which is essential for sustainability.

Step 3: The combination of the cautious sentiment in the management's discussion about potential future challenges with the mix of financial ratios leads to a medium-risk assessment. The negative working capital ratio raises concerns about short-term financial obligations, while the positive retained earnings ratio and EBIT to total assets ratio provide some stability. However, the overall revenue generation relative to total assets is moderate, indicating a challenging quarter.

Step 4: The company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite certain positive financial indicators, the cautionary tone regarding the impact of the pandemic and the negative working capital ratio suggest potential financial challenges ahead. The existing financial stability from retained earnings and EBIT is somewhat counterbalanced by the uncertainty highlighted in the management's discussion.
