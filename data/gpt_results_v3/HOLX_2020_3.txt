Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious as it highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financials. While there is mention of recovery in certain areas, the uncertainties surrounding the ongoing pandemic pose risks. The text states, "While our results of operations and cash flows since the third quarter of fiscal 2020 have been positively impacted by the sale of our COVID-19 assays as well the continued recovery of our other primary product lines and businesses to pre-COVID levels, the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the future."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.325 indicates that the company has a moderate level of working capital relative to its total assets, which may suggest some financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.225 indicates that the company retains a moderate portion of its earnings in relation to its total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.086 suggests that the company generates a moderate level of earnings from its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.441 signifies that the company generates a moderate level of revenue in relation to its total assets.

Step 3: The financial ratios show that the company has moderate levels of working capital, retained earnings, earnings, and revenue in relation to its total assets. While these ratios are not alarmingly low, the cautious sentiment expressed in the management discussion and the uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic suggest a challenging quarter. The increase in revenue is attributed to the sales of COVID-19 assays, which may not be sustainable in the long term.

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, the moderate financial ratios, and the company's reliance on COVID-19 assay sales for revenue, the overall assessment is a Medium Risk of bankruptcy. The company is not in immediate danger but faces challenges that could impact its financial stability in the future.
