Step 1: The sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and realistic. The filing mentions the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations, including a decline in volumes, adjustments in service levels, and increase in costs due to the pandemic. A quote supporting this sentiment is: "The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time."

Step 2: The numbers and figures provided in the discussion show a decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease is attributed to lower volumes, fuel recovery fees, and environmental services revenue, partially offset by increases in average yield and acquisitions. A quote supporting this is: "Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by (1.8)% to $7,580.4 million compared to $7,722.7 million for the same period in 2019."

Step 3: The conditions have worsened for the company due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected in the decrease in revenue and the additional costs incurred as a result of the pandemic. While there are some offsetting factors like increases in average yield, the overall trend indicates a challenging quarter with uncertain future developments. A quote supporting this is: "During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we experienced changes in revenue, including decreases in volumes and environmental services due to lower demand for crude oil."

Overall, considering the cautious sentiment, the decreased revenue, and the challenging conditions with uncertain future impacts, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The impacts of the pandemic on operations, financial performance, and costs contribute to this assessment.
