Medium risk

Step 1: The management discussion text provides a mix of optimistic and cautious statements. While the company discusses significant revenue growth and market expansion opportunities, it also highlights challenges such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clients, potential delays in service implementation, and the overall uncertainty in the business environment. This indicates a balanced view of both opportunities and risks.

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
    - Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0664 - This ratio is relatively low, indicating a potential liquidity issue where current assets may not be sufficient to cover short-term obligations.
    - Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.3502 - This ratio shows a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to total assets, suggesting some stability in the company's financial position.
    - EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1130 - This ratio represents the company's ability to generate profit from its assets, with a moderate value indicating some profitability.
    - Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.4035 - This ratio reflects the company's ability to generate revenue relative to its total assets, showing a reasonable level of revenue generation.

Step 3: Considering the text and financial ratios, the company appears to be facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting client revenues and client-driven delays. The lower working capital indicates a potential liquidity strain, while the retained earnings provide some buffer. Despite moderate profitability (EBIT to Total Assets), the overall sentiment of caution and the current economic climate point towards a challenging quarter.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, the company's medium risk of bankruptcy is supported by the combination of cautious management sentiment, lower working capital ratio, and the ongoing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic on client revenues. Despite some stability in retained earnings, the overall outlook suggests a need for careful financial management to navigate through the uncertainties.
