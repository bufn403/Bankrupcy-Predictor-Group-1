Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious yet optimistic. While the impact of COVID-19 is acknowledged, the company outlines strategies to navigate through the challenges and expresses confidence in their long-term outlook. For example, "The pandemic will come to an end and we believe that we will come out a better company by driving our long-term strategies" shows a positive outlook despite the current uncertainties.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The negative value indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets in the short term, which could be a sign of financial strain.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a positive value, this ratio suggests that the company has been able to generate earnings and reinvest in the business, which is a positive sign for stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): This ratio shows the company's earnings generated from its assets. The positive value indicates a decent level of profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A relatively high value of this ratio implies that the company is generating a significant amount of revenue compared to its assets, which is a good sign.

Step 3: Combining the text analysis and financial ratios, we see a mixed picture. While the company is navigating through COVID-19 challenges with a focus on employee safety and maintaining operations, the negative working capital ratio and uncertain market conditions pose a risk. The decrease in sales in the flavor solutions segment and the impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior also add to the challenges.

Step 4: The company shows resilience and adaptability in the face of the ongoing crisis, but the financial ratios and uncertainties surrounding the pandemic point towards medium risk. The cautious optimism and proactive measures are positive factors, but the negative working capital ratio and challenges in certain segments indicate a level of vulnerability. Continued monitoring of the situation and adapting to changing market conditions will be crucial for the company's future stability.
