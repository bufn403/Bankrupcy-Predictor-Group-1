Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems cautiously optimistic. While they mention the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential risks associated with it, they also highlight positive developments such as significant approvals received in 2020 for various products. They talk about strategic acquisitions and collaborations that position the company for growth. 

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0999 - This ratio indicates a relatively low working capital compared to total assets, which could suggest potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.3023 - This ratio indicates that a significant portion of total assets is financed by retained earnings, which suggests a stable financial structure.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1009 - The EBIT to Total Assets ratio is relatively low, indicating that the company may not be generating significant earnings from its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.4730 - This ratio shows that the company is generating substantial revenue relative to its total assets, which is a positive indicator of operational efficiency.

Step 3: Considering the financial ratios, the company appears to have a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The lower EBIT to Total Assets ratio may indicate operational challenges, but the high Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio is a positive sign. The Working Capital to Total Assets ratio being low could be a concern for short-term financial stability, while the Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio shows a strong foundation.

Step 4: Based on the overall assessment, including the sentiment analysis of the management's discussion and the financial ratios, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positive aspects such as significant revenue generation and strategic partnerships, the lower working capital and EBIT ratios suggest potential financial challenges that need to be addressed to mitigate the risk of bankruptcy. The company's financial health appears to be at a moderate level of risk.
