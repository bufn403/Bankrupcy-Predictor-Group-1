Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems to be cautious but also optimistic about the company's ability to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges, the company has taken measures to mitigate the disruptions and continues to work closely with the U.S. Government to ensure operational continuity.

Step 2: 
   - Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.0683 - This ratio indicates that the company has a relatively low working capital to total assets ratio, which may imply some liquidity concerns.
   - Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.2935 - This ratio suggests that the company has a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to its total assets, indicating some stability in earnings retention.
   - EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1718 - The EBIT to Total Assets ratio shows that the company is generating a moderate level of earnings before interest and taxes in relation to its total assets.
   - Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.2881 - This ratio indicates that the company has a relatively high total revenue to total assets ratio, which may suggest efficient asset utilization.

Step 3: Taking into account the cautious optimism in the management discussion text, the financial ratios indicate a mix of moderate to concerning indicators. The working capital to total assets ratio being relatively low may raise liquidity issues, while the retained earnings to total assets ratio provides some stability. The EBIT to total assets ratio shows the company's ability to generate earnings, and the total revenue to total assets ratio suggests efficient asset utilization. Overall, the company seems to be managing well but may face liquidity challenges.

Step 4: Considering the cautious yet optimistic tone of the management's discussion, along with the mix of financial ratios indicating both stability and potential liquidity concerns, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. While the company is navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic, the liquidity issue highlighted in the working capital ratio raises some level of concern about future financial stability.
