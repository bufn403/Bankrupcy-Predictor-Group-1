Low risk

Step 1: The management's discussion section of the filing seems optimistic overall. They acknowledge the challenges posed by COVID-19 but highlight their strong financial performance, successful navigation of challenges, and prioritization of employee safety. This positive outlook is evident in statements like, "We delivered strong financial performance," and "The well-being of our employees is FMC's top priority."

Step 2: The company's revenue increased by approximately 7 percent in the third quarter of 2020, with growth seen across different regions and driven by higher volumes and favorable pricing.

They also made significant investments in employee well-being and community support. Despite challenges in certain markets, overall demand for their products remained healthy and they expect disruptions to continue but have planned accordingly.

Final Decision: Based on the optimistic sentiment in management's discussion, the successful financial performance, and proactive measures taken in response to COVID-19 challenges, the company appears to have low risk of bankruptcy in the future.
