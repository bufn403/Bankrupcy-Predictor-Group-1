Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious and somewhat pessimistic. The company highlights the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, including temporary closures of facilities, headcount reductions, and suspending dividends to preserve cash and maintain liquidity. One statement that reflects this sentiment is, "Since the start of the pandemic, certain original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers have suspended manufacturing operations...While the pandemic has resulted in temporary closure of a small number of the Company's manufacturing facilities, all of our manufacturing facilities are currently operating."

Step 2: The financial figures provided in the discussion show a significant decline in sales year over year, with sales decreasing by 37% in the third quarter of 2020 and 25% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in sales is primarily attributed to lower volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets due to COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. A key quote supporting this is, "The decrease of $660, or 37%, in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,343, or 25%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to lower volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets..."

Step 3: The cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of sales has increased, indicating potential inefficiencies or higher production costs. The company also incurred costs related to fires at two plants and foresees additional charges related to the fires in subsequent quarters. These factors contribute to the financial challenges the company is facing. A relevant quote is, "In the third quarter of 2020, the Company incurred costs related to fires at two plants...The Company anticipates charges of approximately $5 to $10 in the fourth quarter of 2020, with additional impacts in subsequent quarters as the businesses continue to recover from the fires."

Step 4: Based on the overall cautious sentiment, significant decrease in sales, and challenges with cost management highlighted in the discussion, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertain duration of the pandemic, impact on operations, and the need to take actions to preserve cash all point towards a level of risk that is more than low but not yet high. The company's financial performance is strained, but there are efforts to mitigate these challenges.
