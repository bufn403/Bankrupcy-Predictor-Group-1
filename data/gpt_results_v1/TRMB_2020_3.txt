Medium

Step 1: The overall tone of the management's discussion in the 10-Q filing seems cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge the challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic but also highlight various growth strategies and positive aspects of their performance.

Step 2: In the filing, the company mentions certain financial figures that indicate a mixed performance. For example, they state, "Overall revenue was up 1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020," and "For the first three quarters of 2020, our recurring revenue increased." These numbers show some resilience in their revenue streams but also highlight challenges in other areas such as reduced professional services revenue.

Step 3: The information provided in the filing suggests a mixed performance. The company mentions, "Operating income increased during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2020 due to gross margin expansion," which is a positive sign. However, they also express uncertainty about the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on their business and financial condition, indicating potential risks ahead.

Based on the above analysis, the company shows some positive signs of growth and resilience in their revenue streams, but the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business and financial condition warrants concern. Therefore, the medium risk is assigned.
