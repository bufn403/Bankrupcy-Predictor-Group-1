Medium Risk

Step 1: The management discussion acknowledges the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. They mention that economic conditions have been impacted, leading to decreased demand from customers compared to historical levels.

Step 2: The company experienced a significant decrease in sales for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, with organic sales down 12% and 11%, respectively. Operating income and net income also decreased by 15% and 16%, respectively, for the same periods.

Step 3: Despite cost reduction actions, including employee reductions, and maintaining tight cost control, the company anticipates further decreases in organic sales for the fourth quarter of 2020, ranging from 3 to 5%. The company's liquidity position is strong, with over $1.6 billion available, but the uncertainty regarding the duration of the pandemic and its impact on financial markets remains.

Based on this information, the company is experiencing challenges in its operations due to the pandemic, resulting in declining sales and profitability. While they have taken cost-cutting measures and have sufficient liquidity, the ongoing uncertainties and projections of further sales declines indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
