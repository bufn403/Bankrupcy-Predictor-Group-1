Medium risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While there are discussions about the company adapting to challenges and taking actions to mitigate risks, there is also a clear acknowledgment of the impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. For example, "COVID-19 continues to have an impact on our financial performance as the pandemic endures..." This indicates a level of uncertainty and challenges faced by the company.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets indicates potential liquidity issues and may suggest difficulties in meeting short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The negative value suggests that the company's retained earnings are not sufficient to cover its total assets, indicating financial strain.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The positive value indicates that the company is generating profit from its assets, which is a positive aspect.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): This ratio is relatively high, indicating that the company's total revenue is significant compared to its total assets, which could be a positive sign of efficiency.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment from the management discussion and the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19. The negative working capital to total assets and retained earnings to total assets ratios point towards potential financial strain. Despite a positive EBIT to total assets ratio, the overall picture is mixed, with uncertainty surrounding the company's future financial performance.

Step 4: Medium risk
Based on the mixed sentiment in the management discussion, the negative working capital to total assets and retained earnings to total assets ratios, and the uncertainties highlighted in the text, it suggests that the company is facing financial challenges and a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
