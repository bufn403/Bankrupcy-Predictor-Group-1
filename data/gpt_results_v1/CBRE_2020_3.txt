Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion appears cautiously optimistic. While acknowledging the impact of COVID-19 on their operations, they also highlight resilient revenue streams and opportunities in different parts of their business despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Step 2: The company reported a 4.7% decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by lower sales and leasing revenue in their Advisory Services segment due to COVID-19. However, they also noted improved revenue in their Global Workplace Solutions segment and Real Estate Investments segment, partially due to strategic acquisitions like Telford Homes Plc. The cautious approach towards costs is evident from the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to reduce costs.

Step 3: The company's cost of revenue decreased by 2.6% due to lower commission expenses related to the decline in advisory sales and leasing revenue. Operating, administrative, and other expenses decreased by 1.9%, mainly from reduced compensation expenses and general business operating costs. They also mentioned incurring costs related to transformation initiatives aimed at streamlining operations and reducing costs.

Step 4: Despite the revenue decline and cautious cost-cutting measures, the company shows resilience in certain segments and strategic acquisitions, indicating an ability to adapt to challenges. The implementation of cost-saving initiatives, while reducing expenses, could also indicate a proactive approach to maintain financial stability. On the other hand, the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their advisory services raises concerns about revenue generation in a challenging market environment. Therefore, considering both the positive and challenging aspects of their operations, a medium risk level of bankruptcy seems appropriate as the company navigates through uncertainties.
