Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is a mix of challenges and strategic responses. While they mention the impact of the global pandemic on demand for oil and the need to reduce costs, they also outline plans to preserve cash and maintain business continuity. The tone is cautiously optimistic about adapting to the current situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The company has a very low working capital to total assets ratio of 0.0066, indicating potential liquidity issues and a struggle to cover short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): The retained earnings to total assets ratio of 0.0965 shows a moderate level, suggesting some stability in profitability and reinvestment.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to total asset ratio of 0.1228 indicates that the company is generating a decent level of earnings compared to its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The total revenue to total asset ratio of 0.4378 suggests that the company is efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the text and the financial ratios, it is evident that while the company is facing challenges such as lower realized selling prices, higher exploration expenses, and a net loss, they are implementing cost-saving measures and asset sales to improve liquidity. The ratios show a mixed picture with a very low working capital ratio indicating potential short-term issues, but decent EBIT to total assets ratio reflecting operational profitability.

Step 4: Considering the cautious optimism in the management discussion, the mix of financial ratios, and the company's strategic responses to the challenges, the assessment leans towards medium risk. The company is taking steps to navigate the difficulties but may still face challenges in the near future.
