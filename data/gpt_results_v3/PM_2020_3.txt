Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is largely optimistic. The company highlights its transformation in the tobacco industry towards smoke-free products, stating, "We are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future." This indicates a strategic shift towards potentially more sustainable products.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative working capital to total assets ratio (-0.1015) may raise concerns about short-term financial obligations. However, it's essential to consider the nature of the industry and the company's operations before making a definitive judgment solely based on this ratio.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A high ratio of retained earnings to total assets (0.5220) suggests that the company has been able to accumulate a significant portion of earnings over its operations, indicating financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): EBIT to total assets ratio (0.1834) shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets. A positive ratio implies profitability.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A high total revenue to total assets ratio (0.5386) indicates efficient asset utilization to generate revenue.

Step 3: The company's positive sentiment towards the shift to smoke-free products, along with financial ratios indicating profitability and efficient asset utilization, paints a picture of a company navigating challenges and adapting successfully. The positive retained earnings to total assets ratio signifies stability, while the EBIT to total assets ratio suggests profitability.

Step 4: Based on the optimistic tone in the management discussion, along with the healthy financial ratios indicating stability and profitability, the company seems to have a low risk of bankruptcy in the future. Despite some concerns such as the negative working capital to total assets ratio, the overall financial health appears solid due to the positive indicators.
