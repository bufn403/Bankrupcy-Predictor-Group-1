Step 1: The sentiment of the management discussion appears to be a mix of caution and optimism. While the company acknowledges risks related to the current economic environment, it also discusses positive aspects such as increased sales in certain segments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates a balanced outlook.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) is negative (-0.0479), suggesting potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) is at 0.2993, indicating a moderate level of retained earnings relative to total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) is at 0.0500, implying a low return on assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) is at 0.5567, showing a substantial portion of revenue generated compared to total assets.

Step 3: The financial ratios paint a somewhat mixed picture. The negative working capital indicates a potential short-term liquidity challenge, while the low EBIT to Total Assets ratio suggests a relatively weak profitability on assets. However, the Total Revenue to Total Assets ratio is relatively high, indicating a significant portion of assets being utilized for revenue generation. 

Step 4: Based on the overall assessment of the sentiment in the management discussion, the financial ratios, and the company's performance, the risk of bankruptcy for the company is deemed to be medium. Despite some financial stability concerns, such as negative working capital and low profitability on assets, the company's ability to generate revenue from its assets provides a buffer against immediate bankruptcy risk.
