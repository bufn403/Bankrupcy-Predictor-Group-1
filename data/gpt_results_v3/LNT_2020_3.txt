Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be a mix of optimism and caution. While they discuss challenges presented by COVID-19, they also highlight efforts to mitigate impacts and ensure continuity of service. They state, "Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have not experienced significant impacts on their overall business operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020" which shows resilience in the face of challenges.

Step 2: Analyzing the financial ratios:
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative value indicates potential liquidity issues as working capital is less than the total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Positive value shows a portion of assets financed by retained earnings, which is a positive sign.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): Positive value indicates the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): Positive value signifies a good revenue generation relative to assets.

Step 3: Combining text analysis and financial ratios, the company seems to be navigating challenges well so far. While the negative working capital raises some concerns about liquidity, the positive retained earnings and EBIT ratios demonstrate profitability and financial stability.

Step 4: Taking into account the balanced sentiment in the text, along with the mix of positive and negative financial ratios, the overall assessment leans towards medium risk. The company appears to be managing challenges effectively, but the negative working capital ratio signals a need for attention to liquidity management. The positive retained earnings and revenue ratios provide some cushion, but continued monitoring and proactive measures are advisable to mitigate any potential risks.
