Decision: Medium

Step 1: The management's discussion text provides a detailed overview of Micron Technology, Inc.'s business operations, product portfolio, COVID-19 response, revenue trends, and strategic initiatives. The tone appears cautiously optimistic, acknowledging both challenges and proactive measures taken by the company to mitigate risks. For example, they stated, "We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations." This suggests a balanced perspective in addressing uncertainties.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.256 indicates a positive working capital position, which generally signifies liquidity to cover short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.635 reflects a significant portion of assets being financed with retained earnings, indicating stability and profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): -0.082 suggests a negative EBIT relative to total assets, which could signal operational challenges.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.242 shows that a considerable portion of assets is generating revenue, indicating operational efficiency.

Step 3: Combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, the company appears to be navigating through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various strategies to maintain operations and support market demand. While the financial ratios show areas of strength such as a positive working capital position and a high proportion of assets financed by retained earnings, the negative EBIT to Total Assets ratio signals a need for improvement in operational efficiency. The company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain a focus on innovation could contribute to its overall financial health.

Step 4: Considering the balanced sentiment in the management's discussion, the mix of financial ratios indicating both strengths and areas for improvement, and the company's proactive approach to challenges, Micron Technology, Inc. is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's strong liquidity position and profitability indicators are balanced by the need for enhancing operational efficiency to ensure sustained financial stability.
