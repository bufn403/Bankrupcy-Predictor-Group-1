Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: 
The sentiment in the management's discussion text is a mix of optimism and caution. While they discuss challenges like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to Brexit, they also highlight efforts to ensure business continuity, liquidity, and cost-saving measures. 

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.09507248995077 - This ratio indicates that the company has a positive working capital, which is generally a good sign for financial stability.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): -0.1148322117338873 - A negative value for this ratio can be concerning as it suggests that the company's losses have exceeded the retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.1262213389940231 - This ratio shows the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets, which is a positive sign.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.6090811917558676 - A high value for this ratio might indicate efficient asset utilization.

Step 3:
Combining the insights from the text analysis and financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically on customer demand and revenue. While there are positive aspects like positive working capital and EBIT to Total Assets ratio, the negative Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio raises some concerns about the company's profitability and financial health.

Step 4:
Based on the overall analysis, including the mix of positive and negative factors, it seems that the company is in a medium risk of bankruptcy. While some financial indicators are positive, the challenges mentioned in the text and the negative Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio warrant caution about the company's financial stability in the future.
