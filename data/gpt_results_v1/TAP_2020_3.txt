Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is pessimistic. The company acknowledges the negative impact of the global pandemic on its operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. They highlight how the closures of on-premise locations due to governmental regulations have significantly affected their business. For example, "We are actively monitoring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which had a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations during the second quarter of 2020 due to the on-premise closures worldwide."

Step 2: Relevant figures and projections in the filing indicate a struggling quarter and uncertain future outlook. The company recorded charges related to the pandemic, such as temporary pay for employees and keg relief programs, impacting their cost of goods sold. They also withdrew their financial outlook for 2020 due to the unpredictability brought on by the pandemic. For example, "During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 we recorded charges of $15.5 million within cost of goods sold related to temporary 'thank you' pay for certain essential North America brewery employees."

Step 3: The company's quarter results depict a mixed picture with decreased net sales but improved net income compared to the prior year, driven by lower special charges and cost-saving measures. However, the decline in net sales was attributed to continued on-premise restrictions, highlighting ongoing challenges. For example, "Net sales of approximately $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2020 decreased 3.1% from the prior year, driven by financial volume declines related to continued on-premise restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic."

Step 4: Considering the overall pessimistic sentiment, the significant adverse effects of the pandemic on their operations, and the uncertainty surrounding the future impact, the company is facing medium risk of bankruptcy. Although they have implemented cost-saving measures and reported improved net income, the challenging market conditions and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic's impact indicate a heightened level of risk in the foreseeable future.
