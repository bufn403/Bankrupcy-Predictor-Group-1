Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the Management Discussion Text leans towards optimism. The text highlights the company's resilience, recovery efforts, and strategic investments for long-term growth. For example, "The sequential improvements in our quarterly results demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand." This suggests a positive outlook despite challenges faced.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value indicates potential liquidity issues, as working capital is insufficient to cover short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Another negative value indicates that the portion of total assets financed by retained earnings is relatively low, which could signify financial strain.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): A positive ratio suggests the company is generating earnings before interest and taxes in relation to its total assets, which is favorable.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A value greater than 1 indicates that total revenue generated exceeds total assets, which could indicate efficiency in asset utilization.

Step 3: The financial ratios present a mixed picture. While EBIT to Total Assets (X3) shows a positive trend in generating earnings, Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) and Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) indicate potential liquidity and financial leverage concerns. The Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) ratio suggests efficient asset utilization but does not provide a complete financial health overview.

Step 4: Considering the overall sentiment of resilience and strategic investments along with the financial ratios indicating liquidity and financial leverage challenges, the company is assessed to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. The optimism expressed in the text is balanced by the concerns raised by the financial ratios, pointing towards a cautious outlook for the company's future financial stability.
