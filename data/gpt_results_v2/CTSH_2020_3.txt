Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion section is a mix of cautious optimism and acknowledgment of challenges. For example, they mention, "Despite these efforts, in the first half of the year we experienced some delays in project fulfillment as delivery, particularly in India and the Philippines, shifted to work-from-home." This shows the company faced challenges due to the pandemic.

Step 2: The company discusses future projections and factors influencing their decisions, like, "We continue to implement our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan... The optimization measures that are part of the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan are expected to result in total charges of approximately $200 million." They are taking steps to adapt to the changing environment.

Step 3: The discussion also mentions the impact of past decisions, such as, "Our 2019 decision to exit certain content-related services negatively impacted our third quarter 2020 revenues..." indicating past choices affecting current financials which could be a risk factor.

Final Decision: The company is facing challenges due to the pandemic, undergoing restructuring, and dealing with revenue impact from past decisions. While they are taking steps to adapt, the uncertainties mentioned, along with the negative impacts faced, indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future.
