Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion indicates a challenging quarter due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The text mentions, "Our net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2020, decreased 82.0%... The decrease was across our jurisdictions and properties with decreases of $1.94 billion, $512 million and $214 million at our Macao operations, Marina Bay Sands, and our Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively." This shows a significant decline in revenues across the company's properties.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.062 indicates a relatively low working capital compared to total assets, which may signal liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.119 shows a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to total assets.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.119 reflects the earnings before interest and taxes relative to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.476 indicates that a significant portion of total assets is generating revenue.

Step 3: The low working capital ratio (X1) suggests potential liquidity challenges for the company, while the moderate levels of retained earnings (X2) and EBIT (X3) show some stability in earnings and assets. However, the significant decline in net revenues (as mentioned in Step 1) raises concerns about the company's ability to generate sufficient income to cover expenses and debt obligations.

Step 4: Considering the challenging quarter with a substantial decrease in revenues, along with the low working capital ratio implying liquidity issues, and the moderate levels of retained earnings and EBIT, it indicates a medium risk of bankruptcy for the company. Despite some stability in earnings and assets, the current financial situation and uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic pose a significant risk to the company's financial health.
