High risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is pessimistic. They highlight the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding on their business, revenue, earnings, and liquidity. They express uncertainty about the future recovery of the commercial airline industry.

Step 2: The company reported decreases in revenues for both the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily attributed to lower deliveries, COVID-19 impacts, and 737 MAX grounding. Loss from operations increased significantly, reflecting the absence of MAX deliveries, lower margins, abnormal production costs, and severance costs.

Step 3: The company expects the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding to continue significantly impacting revenues and earnings in future quarters until the industry recovers. They anticipate reductions in backlog and continued cancellations of orders, especially in the 737 MAX program.

Step 4: Overall, based on the pessimistic sentiment, significant decreases in revenues, and increasing losses, coupled with uncertainties surrounding the recovery of the airline industry, the company exhibits a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the continued grounding of the 737 MAX pose significant challenges to the company's financial stability and operations.
