1. **Step 1:**
The sentiment in the management's discussion appears to be cautious and acknowledges the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company mentions the adverse effects of the pandemic on their operations, customer base, and global economic conditions. This cautious tone is evident in the statement: "While we do not currently believe that the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a material adverse impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable, global economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our customers, which could impact our future ability to collect our accounts receivable."

2. **Step 2:**
The company discusses taking cost-saving measures and capital expenditure management in response to the pandemic-induced challenges. They have highlighted several actions to manage costs, such as terminations, reductions in workforce, deferral of capital investments, and freezes on acquisitions. This quote illustrates their efforts: "We have taken certain actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to manage our costs and capital expenditures..."

3. **Step 3:**
The discussion on Project Summit, although aimed at achieving growth, also entails substantial costs ($450.0 million) with expected completion by the end of 2021. While the project is expected to bring benefits in the future, the significant costs associated with it during the pandemic raise concerns about immediate financial strain. The statement, "Including the expanded scope of Project Summit described above, we estimate that the implementation of Project Summit will result in total costs of approximately $450.0 million..." suggests a substantial financial commitment amidst ongoing economic uncertainties.

4. **Final Decision:**
Considering the cautious sentiment towards the pandemic's impact, the cost-saving measures taken, and the substantial costs of Project Summit during uncertain times, the overall risk of bankruptcy for the company appears to be at a medium level. The company's ability to weather the current economic challenges and manage the costs of strategic initiatives will be critical in determining their future financial stability.
