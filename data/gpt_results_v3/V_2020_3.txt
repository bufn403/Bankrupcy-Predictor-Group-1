Step 1: The overall sentiment from the management's discussion is cautious and uncertain due to the impact of COVID-19 on the business. The company mentions, "the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties." This uncertainty indicates a level of risk in the future.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): The ratio of 0.115 indicates that the company has a relatively low level of working capital compared to its total assets, which could signal potential liquidity issues.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): With a ratio of 0.199, the company has a moderate level of retained earnings in relation to its total assets, indicating some stability in the company's financial position.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The ratio of 0.239 shows that the company generates a decent level of earnings before interest and taxes in relation to its total assets, which is a positive sign.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): The ratio of 0.361 demonstrates that the company generates a significant amount of revenue in relation to its total assets, showing good asset utilization.

Step 3: Combining the caution expressed in the management discussion with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is facing challenges due to the uncertainties related to COVID-19. While the earnings and revenue generation seem relatively stable, the lower working capital ratio suggests a potential strain on liquidity in the current economic environment, impacting the company's risk profile.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, mixed financial ratios, and uncertain business outlook due to COVID-19, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The combination of lower working capital, moderate retained earnings, and revenue generation, along with the uncertain impact of the pandemic, poses a moderate level of risk to the company's financial stability in the future.
