We serve a broad base of end-user markets, with a primary focus towards automotive and industrial and including communications, computing and consumer. As of March 31, 2023, we were organized into the three operating and reportable segments of PSG, ASG and ISG.
Our primary focus continues to be on profitable revenue growth in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure, as well as obtaining longer-term supply arrangements with strategic end-customers. We are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures. Additionally, we continue to rationalize our product portfolio by moving away from non-differentiated, non-strategic products, which in most cases had lower gross and operating margins.
In order to streamline our operations and achieve organizational efficiencies, we realigned our operating models in ASG and the Corporate Information Technology ("IT") organization during the first quarter of 2023. Under this business realignment, approximately 400 employees were notified of their employment termination, and we incurred severance and related charges of approximately $41.4 million. We continue to evaluate employee positions and locations for potential efficiencies and may incur additional severance and related charges in the future. For additional information, see Note 4: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
During the first quarter of 2023, we completed the offering of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Notes and utilized the net proceeds along with cash generated from operations to which were used (i) to repay $1,086.0 million of the existing outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s Term Loan “B” Facility and the related transaction fees and expenses, (ii) to pay approximately $171.5 million net cost of the related convertible note hedges after such costs were offset by the proceeds from the sale of warrants, and (iii) for general corporate purposes.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we repaid $125.0 million of the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements (in millions):
Revenue was $1,959.7 million and $1,945.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively, representing an increase of $14.7 million, or approximately 1%. We had one customer, a distributor, whose revenue accounted for approximately 10.1% and 12.4% of our total revenue for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively.Revenue by operating and reportable segments was as follows (dollars in millions):
(1) Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.Revenue from PSG increased by $26.1 million, or approximately 3%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The revenue from our Advanced Power Division increased by $96.6 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of $70.5 million in our Integrated Circuits, Protection and Signal Division. The increases were primarily driven by our continued ramp in SiC and other high-power automotive solutions, compared to the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The decrease in revenue generated by our Integrated Circuits, Protection and Signal Division was driven by planned customer product exits and reduced demand driven by lower end-market requirements for these products. Revenue from ASG decreased by $96.5 million, or approximately 14%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The revenue from our Mobile, Computing and Cloud Division decreased by $109.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase of $18.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively, in our Automotive Division and Industrial Solutions Division driven by Foundry business through our new EFK location. The decrease in revenue generated by our Mobile, Computing and Cloud Division was influenced by our 2023 exit of our Quantenna business, planned end of life for targeted products as well as a general drop in end market demand for these products. Revenue from ISG increased by $85.1 million, or approximately 32%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the quarter ended April 1, 2022, largely driven by an increase in revenue from our Automotive Sensing Division of $90.9 million. The increase was due to an increase in demand for these products and an increase in average selling prices, compared to the quarter ended April 1, 2022.Revenue by geographic location, based on sales billed from the respective country or region, was as follows (dollars in millions):
(1) Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.
Our gross profit by operating and reportable segments was as follows (dollars in millions):
(1)Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.During the quarter ended March 31, 2023 our gross profit was $917.5 million and our gross margin was 46.8%, representing a decline of approximately $43.8 million and a 4.6% decrease compared to a gross profit of $961.3 million and a gross margin of 49.4% reported for the quarter ended April 1, 2022.The decline in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily driven by start-up and ramp-up costs associated with the ramp up of our EFK facility and new products.
Research and development expenses were $138.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $156.8 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2022, representing a decrease of $18.4 million, or approximately 12%. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in payroll, variable compensation and other expenses as a result of the restructuring programs implemented during the period.Selling and marketing expenses were $71.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $71.1 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2022, representing an increase of $0.7 million, or approximately 1%. General and administrative expenses were $75.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $77.9 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2022, representing a decrease of $2.0 million, or approximately 3%. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation and other expenses as a result of the restructuring programs implemented during the period.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $15.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $21.3 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2022, representing a decrease of $6.3 million, or approximately 30%. The decrease in expense was due to the impairment of certain intangible assets recorded due to the QCS shutdown during the third quarter of 2022 and a reduction in amortization expense as certain intangible technology-related assets became fully amortized in 2022.
Restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was $51.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to a credit of $13.0 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2022. Amounts incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 primarily related to the business realignment that was announced in the first quarter of 2023. Amounts incurred for the quarter ended April 1, 2022 were partially offset by a gain from the sale of an office building in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 4: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.
Interest expense increased by $4.8 million to $26.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $21.6 million during the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding long-term debt balances and an increase in interest rates offset by effects of interest rate swap agreements. Our average gross long-term debt balance (including current maturities) for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was $3,371.4 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.1%, as compared to $3,256.3 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.7% for the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The calculation of our weighted-average interest rates includes the effect of our interest rate swap agreements.
We recorded loss on debt prepayment of $13.3 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The loss is attributable to the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs written-off relating to the repayment of the Term Loan "B" Facility. See Note 6: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Other income (expense) resulted in an income of $4.7 million compared to an income of $2.1 million during the quarter ended April 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a gain resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps partially offset by transaction losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies.
We recorded an income tax provision of $83.7 million and $97.1 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 15.3% and 15.5%.
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as well as debt and/or equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our cash requirements (including any amounts required to satisfy our current portion of long-term debt) utilizing any or a combination of these principal sources. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, and the Revolving Credit Facility has approximately $1.6 billion available for future borrowings.We require cash to: (i) fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments; (ii) service our debt, including principal and interest; (iii) conduct research and development; (iv) incur capital expenditures; and (v) repurchase our common stock. During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.We believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from our operations and the Revolving Credit Facility are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and other business needs for at least the next 12 months.
Our long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. Our cash flows from operating activities were $408.9 million and $478.6 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively. The decrease of $69.7 million was primarily attributable to a reduction in net income driven by lower end-market requirements for our productsOur ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets. Management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows.
Our cash flows used in investing activities were $562.0 million and $129.4 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively. The increase of $432.6 million was primarily attributable to capital expenditures and the remaining payment of $236.3 million related to the acquisition of the EFK facility. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, we paid $321.5 million and $173.8 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2023 increased to approximately 16%, primarily as a result of the SiC expansion and our facility expansion investments. As a result of these investments, for 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 18% to 20% of revenue.
Our cash flows used in financing activities were $63.4 million and $57.3 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively. The increase of $6.1 million was primarily attributable to proceeds and payments related to long-term borrowings and share repurchase activity. Cash used in financing activities includes repayments of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s Term Loan “B” Facility of $1.1 billion and $125.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company also paid approximately $414 million for convertible note hedges and approximately $104.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, offset by $1.5 billion of proceeds from the private unregistered offering of our 0.50% Notes and $242.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of warrants.
We believe that the key factors that could adversely affect our internal and external sources of cash include, among other considerations:•Changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, supply chain constraints, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency, and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and•The debt and equity capital markets could impact our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.
As of March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes, 3.875% Notes and 1.625% Notes, and with covenants relating to our Term Loan "B" Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes, 3.875% Notes and 1.625% Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of onsemi and its guarantor subsidiaries, rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and, as unsecured obligations, are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.
