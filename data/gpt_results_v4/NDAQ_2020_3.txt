The significant economic turmoil caused by COVID-19, the borrowing undertaken to address liquidity concerns, and the continued impact on certain market segments suggest a precarious financial situation. The uncertainties surrounding the economic downturn and the potential disruptions to operations pose a high risk of bankruptcy for the company in the foreseeable future.
