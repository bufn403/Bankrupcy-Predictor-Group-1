Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is mixed. While there is a strong emphasis on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance, there is also a focus on taking necessary measures to protect liquidity and manage cash flow. The discussion outlines the challenges faced by the company due to COVID-19, including customer liquidity constraints, temporary closures, cancellations, and operational limitations.

Step 2:
- Organic Sales Decline: The organic sales decrease reflects a challenging business environment, primarily driven by declines in new equipment and service segments due to COVID-19 implications.
- Cost Reduction Actions: The company has implemented cost containment actions, including reducing discretionary spending, payroll costs, and restructuring, to navigate through the impact of the pandemic.
- Restructuring Charges: The company has incurred restructuring charges, primarily aimed at reducing workforce-related expenses to align with market conditions and changing demands.

Step 3: The company has faced operational challenges and financial impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to declines in organic sales, increased restructuring charges, and higher operational costs. While the company has taken steps to manage its cost structure and preserve liquidity, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's effects on the business environment presents medium risk.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's efforts to reduce costs, manage cash flow, and navigate the challenges posed by COVID-19 are critical in mitigating the risk of bankruptcy. However, the sustained impact of the pandemic on operations and financial performance, coupled with restructuring charges and revenue declines, indicate a medium level of risk in the current environment.
