Step 1: Analyze the overall sentiment of the management's discussion, and whether it is optimistic or pessimistic.
The management discussion provides a balanced view of the company's performance, acknowledging both positive and negative impacts. For example, they mention the positive impact of the Grubhub investment on diluted EPS growth but also discuss the adverse effects of COVID-19 on sales. This neutral tone suggests caution.

Step 2: Observe relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion.
- The company experienced a significant decline in worldwide same-store sales of 2% and 8% for the quarter and year, respectively, due to the impact of COVID-19.
- Net units declined by 267 for the quarter and 44 for the year to date, including closures in the Pizza Hut system.
- They recognized pre-tax income related to changes in the fair value of investments, impacting diluted EPS positively.

Step 3: Determine whether the numbers and figures represent a successful or failed quarter, and if the conditions are likely to improve or worsen.
- The decline in same-store sales and net units signifies a challenging quarter for the company.
- The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on sales and uncertainties about future results indicate potential challenges ahead.

Step 4: Output your final decision on whether the company has a low, medium, or high risk of bankruptcy in the future.
The company's mixed performance with declining same-store sales, net unit closures, and ongoing challenges due to COVID-19 suggests a medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties around the recovery of franchisees, the impact of closures, and the impairment charges related to acquisitions contribute to this assessment.
