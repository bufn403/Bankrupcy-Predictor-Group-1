We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, independent software vendors, retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com.

For our first quarter of fiscal 2023, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by the ongoing shift towards a digital-first world. As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences. Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users, continue to attract new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. We continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses, and is also included in our Creative Cloud all apps subscription offering.As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:
Creative ARR exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $11.28 billion, up from $10.98 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. Document Cloud ARR exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $2.39 billion, up from $2.28 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $13.67 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $13.26 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $2.76 billion, up from $2.55 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing 8% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $634 million, up from $562 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $3.40 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $3.11 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing 9% year-over-year growth driven by strong net new user growth.
We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage are strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to integrate our comprehensive set of solutions.Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:•Data insights and activation. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver robust customer profiles and AI-powered analytics across the customer journey to provide timely, relevant experiences across platforms.•Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses with Adobe Commerce.•Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases, including through Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer.•Marketing planning and workflow. We offer Adobe Workfront, a work management platform directed toward marketers to orchestrate campaign workflows.In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. Digital Experience revenue was $1.18 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $1.06 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue, which grew to $1.04 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from $932 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing 12% year-over-year growth.
As a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of increased global inflationary pressures and interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impacts of current and future trade regulations and the Russia-Ukraine war. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results. For example, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our revenue and earnings during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022, and may continue to negatively impact our financial results for the remainder of fiscal 2023.While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business.
In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 3, 2023, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2, 2022.
•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $13.67 billion as of March 3, 2023 increased by $410 million, or 3%, from $13.26 billion as of December 2, 2022. The change in our Digital Media ARR is primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.•Creative revenue during the three months ended March 3, 2023 of $2.76 billion increased by $213 million, or 8%, compared to the year-ago period. Document Cloud revenue during the three months ended March 3, 2023 of $634 million increased by $72 million, or 13%, compared to the year-ago period. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.•Digital Experience revenue of $1.18 billion during the three months ended March 3, 2023 increased by $119 million, or 11%, compared to the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.•Remaining performance obligations of $15.21 billion as of March 3, 2023 remained relatively flat compared to December 2, 2022.•Cost of revenue of $568 million during the three months ended March 3, 2023 increased by $56 million, or 11%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increases in hosting services and data center costs.•Operating expenses of $2.50 billion during the three months ended March 3, 2023 increased by $331 million, or 15%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as professional fees including costs associated with our planned acquisition of Figma.•Cash flows from operations of $1.69 billion during the three months ended March 3, 2023 decreased by $76 million, or 4%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to higher cash payments for income taxes.
Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services. We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are recognized on a usage basis.We have the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. Subscription revenue by reportable segment for the three months ended March 3, 2023 and March 4, 2022 is as follows:
Our product revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to licenses for on-premise software purchased on a perpetual basis, for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. We primarily recognize product revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.
Revenue by major offerings in our Digital Media reportable segment for the three months ended March 3, 2023 and March 4, 2022 were as follows:
Revenue from Digital Media increased $285 million during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 driven by increases in revenue associated with our Creative and Document Cloud subscription offerings due to continued demand amid an increasingly digital environment and strong customer acquisition and engagement, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Revenue from Digital Experience increased $119 million during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 primarily due to net new additions across our subscription offerings and strong demand for services, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Overall revenue during the three months ended March 3, 2023 increased in all geographic regions as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 primarily due to increases in Digital Media and Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against foreign currencies, including the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, which decreased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents by $169 million. For the three months ended March 3, 2023, the foreign currency impacts to revenue were offset in part by net hedging gains from our cash flow hedging program of $21 million.

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party hosting services and data center costs, including expenses related to operating our network infrastructure. Cost of subscription revenue also includes compensation costs associated with network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, royalty fees, software costs and amortization of certain intangible assets.Cost of subscription revenue increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 due to the following:
Cost of product revenue is primarily comprised of third-party royalties, localization costs and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.
Cost of services and other revenue is primarily comprised of compensation and contracted costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support, and hosting services and data center costs.Cost of services and other revenue increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 primarily due to increases in compensation costs.
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and contracted costs associated with software development, third-party hosting services and data center costs, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in development activities. Research and development expenses increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 due to the following:
Investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our subscription and service offerings, applications and tools.
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, amortization of contract acquisition costs, including sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and events, public relations and other market development programs.Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 due to the following:
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and contracted costs, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance.General and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 due to the following:
Professional and consulting fees increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 primarily due to incurred transaction costs associated with our planned acquisition of Figma.
(*)    Percentage is less than 1%.(**)    Percentage is not meaningful.
Interest expense represents interest associated with our debt instruments. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1.
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.Other income (expense), net increased during the three months ended March 3, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 4, 2022 primarily due to increases in interest income driven by higher average interest rates.
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately four percentage points primarily due to a net tax expense related to stock-based compensation recorded during the three months ended March 3, 2023, as compared to a net tax benefit related to stock-based compensation recorded during the three months ended March 4, 2022.Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 3, 2023 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to a net tax expense related to stock-based compensation and state taxes, partially offset by the U.S. federal research tax credit.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $418 million as of March 3, 2023, primarily related to certain state credits.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. The current U.S. tax law subjects the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to U.S. tax and generally allows an exemption from taxation for distributions from foreign subsidiaries.In the current global tax policy environment, the domestic and foreign governing bodies continue to consider, and in some cases introduce, changes in regulations applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. As regulations are issued, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment.Beginning in 2023, under the provisions introduced by the U.S. Tax Act, we are required to capitalize and amortize research and development costs. If the rule is not modified, there will continue to be an adverse impact on our effective rates for income taxes paid, which is partially offset by a benefit to our effective tax rates from the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, in fiscal 2023 and beyond.
The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $330 million and $298 million as of March 3, 2023 and March 4, 2022, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of March 3, 2023 and March 4, 2022 were recognized, $214 million and $203 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.As of March 3, 2023 and March 4, 2022, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $19 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $15 million over the next 12 months.Our future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
This data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
A summary of our cash flows is as follows:
Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. Our primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below and general business expenses including payroll, income taxes, marketing and third-party hosting services. Other sources of cash include proceeds from maturing short-term investments. Other uses of cash include repayment of maturing senior notes, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.69 billion for the three months ended March 3, 2023 was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The primary working capital uses of cash were the payment of accrued bonuses, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue driven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings.
Net cash provided by investing activities of $156 million for the three months ended March 3, 2023 was primarily due to maturities of short-term investments during the quarter partially offset by ongoing capital expenditures.
Net cash used for financing activities of $2.01 billion for the three months ended March 3, 2023 was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases, the repayment of our 2023 Notes and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. The above uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock mainly for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our planned cash outlay.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in titled Part II, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of March 3, 2023 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. We expect to finance the cash portion of the consideration using cash on hand and debt instruments. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of equity issuances to our employees.
In January 2023, we entered into a delayed draw credit agreement, providing for a senior unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) of up to $3.5 billion for the purpose of partially funding the purchase price and related fees for our acquisition of Figma. The Term Loan is available for funding in a single drawing upon the closing of the Figma acquisition at any time prior to March 15, 2024 and will mature two years following the initial funding date. As of March 3, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.
We have a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through June 30, 2027. Subject to the agreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. As of March 3, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the entire $1.5 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
We have $3.65 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of March 3, 2023, the carrying value of our senior notes was $3.63 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $366 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. See Note 14 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt.
Our principal commitments as of March 3, 2023 consisted of purchase obligations resulting from agreements to purchase goods and services in the ordinary course of business and obligations under operating lease arrangements. There have been no material changes in those obligations during the three months ended March 3, 2023.
Beginning in 2023, under the provisions introduced by the U.S. Tax Act, we are required to capitalize and amortize research and development costs. If the rule is not modified, there will continue to be an adverse impact on our effective rates for income taxes paid, which is partially offset by a benefit from the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, in fiscal 2023 and beyond.The Inflation Reduction Act enacted in 2022 introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions on our results of operations and cash flows.
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.During the three months ended March 3, 2023, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares of our common stock. Subsequent to March 3, 2023, the ASR was settled, which resulted in total repurchases of 4.0 million shares at an average purchase price of $348.46.During the three months ended March 3, 2023, we repurchased a total of 5.0 million shares, including approximately 1.8 million shares at an average price of $330.52 through a structured repurchase agreement entered into during fiscal 2022, as well as 3.2 million shares from the initial delivery of the ASR.Subsequent to March 3, 2023, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1 billion. Upon completion of the $1 billion stock repurchase agreement, $4.15 billion remains under our December 2020 authority.
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
