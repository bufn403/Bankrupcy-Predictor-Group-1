High Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management discussion section is pessimistic due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results. The filing highlights a sharp decline in revenues and significant cost-cutting measures, indicating a challenging environment.

Step 2: The relevant figures provided in the discussion show a substantial decline in total revenues, with a 84.3% decrease in the third quarter and a 67.3% decrease year-to-date due to the pandemic. The company also reported significant decreases in key metrics such as RevPAR, net income, and Adjusted EBITDAre.

Step 3: The numbers reveal a failed quarter with significant losses in net income, earnings per share, and operational metrics like RevPAR. Despite a slight increase in occupancy during the quarter, the overall financial impact of the pandemic has been severe, leading to a decline in performance across all key indicators.

Therefore, based on the pessimistic sentiment, the substantial decline in figures, and the continued uncertainty surrounding the impact of the pandemic on the company's operations and financial outlook, the company is classified as having a high risk of bankruptcy.
