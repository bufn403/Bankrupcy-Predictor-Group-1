Hess Corporation is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States, Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia.  We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada.  At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block.  We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block by the end of 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at March 31, 2023, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGL); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are forecast to be approximately $3.7 billion for 2023.  Oil and gas net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 365,000 boepd to 375,000 boepd.  For the remainder of 2023, we have WTI put options for 80,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel and Brent put options for 50,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel.
In the first quarter of 2023, net income was $346 million, compared with $417 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods detailed on page 23, adjusted net income was $404 million in the first quarter of 2022.  The decrease in adjusted after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the prior-year quarter was primarily due to lower realized selling prices partially offset by the net impact of higher production volumes in the first quarter of 2023.
In the first quarter of 2023, E&P had net income of $405 million compared with $460 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Total net production averaged 374,000 boepd in the first quarter 2023, compared with 276,000 boepd, proforma for asset sold, in the first quarter of 2022.  The average realized crude oil selling price, including hedging, was $74.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $86.75 per barrel in the first quarter of 2022.  The average realized NGL selling price in the first quarter of 2023 was $24.25 per barrel, compared with $39.79 per barrel in the prior-year quarter, while the average realized natural gas selling price was $4.39 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $5.28 per mcf in the first quarter of 2022.The following is an update of our ongoing E&P activities:•In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken averaged 163,000 boepd for the first quarter of 2023 (2022 Q1: 152,000 boepd), primarily due to higher NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased drilling and completion activity.  We added a fourth drilling rig in July 2022 and drilled 25 wells, completed 26 wells, and brought 24 new wells online during the first quarter of 2023.•In the Gulf of Mexico, net production for the first quarter of 2023 averaged 33,000 boepd (2022 Q1: 30,000 boepd) primarily due to an additional well brought online at the Llano Field.•At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, net production from the Liza Destiny and Liza Unity FPSOs totaled 112,000 bopd for the first quarter of 2023 (2022 Q1: 30,000 bopd).  Net production from Guyana in the first quarter of 2023 included 15,000 bopd of tax barrels (2022 Q1: 0 bopd).  The Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022, reached its production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022.  In the first quarter of 2023, we sold nine cargos of crude oil from Guyana compared with two cargos in the prior year quarter.
The third development, Payara, which will utilize the Prosperity FPSO with a production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd, is targeted for startup early in the fourth quarter of 2023.  The Prosperity FPSO arrived at the Stabroek Block on April 11th and hook-up and commissioning activities have commenced.  The fourth development, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 and will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2025.In April, we announced the final investment decision to proceed with the development of the Uaru Field, the fifth development on the Stabroek Block, after the development plan received approval from the Government of Guyana.  Uaru will have a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd with production targeted to startup in 2026.  Up to ten drill centers and 44 production and injection wells are planned.In April, we announced an oil discovery at the Lancetfish-1 well which encountered approximately 92 feet of oil bearing sandstone reservoir.  The well was drilled in 5,843 feet of water by the Noble Don Taylor and is located approximately 4 miles southeast of the Fangtooth discovery.In April, the operator completed drilling of the Kokwari-1 exploration well.  The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and well costs of $20 million incurred through March 31, 2023 were expensed.  We estimate approximately $10 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the second quarter of 2023 for well costs incurred after March 31, 2023.•In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A-18 of the JDA averaged 37,000 boepd for the first quarter of 2023 (2022 Q1: 38,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia.  Net production from North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia, averaged 29,000 boepd for the first quarter of 2023 (2022 Q1: 26,000 boepd).The following is an update of significant Midstream activities:•In March 2023, HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, repurchased approximately 3.6 million HESM Opco Class B units held by a subsidiary of Hess Corporation and an affiliate of GIP for $100 million, financed by HESM Opco's revolving credit facility, of which we received net proceeds of $50 million.  After giving effect to this transaction, we continue to own an approximate 41% interest in Hess Midstream LP, on a consolidated basis.
The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below:
The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability of earnings between periods:
The items in the table above are explained on page 23.
The following table reconciles reported net income attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income attributable to Hess Corporation:
The following table reconciles reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities:
Adjusted net income attributable to Hess Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods, which are summarized on page 23.  Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods.These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis.  Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.  Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount.  After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.
Following is a summarized income statement of our E&P operations:
The changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.
Selling Prices:  Lower realized selling prices in the first quarter of 2023 reduced after-tax earnings by approximately $410 million compared to the same period in 2022.  Average selling prices were as follows:
Crude oil hedging activities were a net loss of $34 million before and after income taxes in the first quarter of 2023, and a net loss of $92 million before and after income taxes in the first quarter of 2022.  For the remainder of 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel, and 50,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel.  We expect noncash premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our results by approximately $50 million in the second quarter and by approximately $190 million for the full year 2023.
Production Volumes:  Our daily worldwide net production was as follows:
We forecast net production to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boped for the second quarter, and in the range of 365,000 boepd to 375,000 boepd for the full year 2023.United States:  North Dakota net production was higher in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to higher NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased drilling and completion activity.  Total offshore net production was higher in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to an additional well brought online at the Llano Field.International:  Net production in Guyana was higher in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to production ramp up from the Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022 and reached its expected production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022.  Net production from Guyana included 15,000 bopd of tax barrels in the first quarter of 2023 (2022 Q1: 0 bopd).
Sales Volumes:  Higher sales volumes in the first quarter of 2023 increased after-tax earnings by approximately $590 million compared to the corresponding period in 2022.  Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows:
Marketing, including Purchased Oil and Gas:  Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the United States, and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. and Guyana marketing activities.  Marketing expense was lower in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to lower third party crude oil volumes purchased and prices paid for purchased volumes.Cash Operating Costs:  Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses.  Cash operating costs increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to the production ramp up in Guyana from the Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022, increased maintenance activity in North Dakota, and higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico partially offset by lower production and severance taxes associated with lower crude oil prices.  On a per-unit basis, the decrease in cash operating costs in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the corresponding period in 2022, primarily reflects the impact of the higher production volumes.Midstream Tariffs Expense:  Tariffs expense in the first quarter of 2023 was comparable with the corresponding period in 2022.  We estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million in the second quarter of 2023, and in the range of $1,230 million to $1,250 million for the full year 2023.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A):  DD&A expense and per-unit rates were higher in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to higher production from Guyana following the start-up of Liza Phase 2 in February 2022.Unit Costs:  Unit cost per boe information is based on total net production volumes.  Actual and forecast unit costs per boe are as follows:
Exploration Expenses:  Exploration expenses were as follows:
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, are estimated to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter of 2023 and in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the full year 2023.Income Taxes:  E&P income tax expense was $170 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $192 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Income tax expense from Libya operations, sold in November 2022, was $154 million in the first quarter of 2022.  The decrease in Libya income tax expense in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 was partially offset by higher income tax expense in Guyana as a result of higher pre-tax income.  We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream), and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  There is a reasonable possibility that if anticipated future earnings come to fruition and no other unforeseen negative evidence materializes, sufficient positive evidence may become available to support the release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance in these jurisdictions in the near term.  This would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded.  Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, E&P income tax expense is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the second quarter of 2023 and in the range of $670 million to $680 million for the full year 2023.
Following is a summarized income statement for our Midstream operations:
Sales and other operating revenues for the first quarter of 2023 decreased, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower minimum volume commitments in the first quarter of 2023.  Interest expense for the first quarter of 2023 increased, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, primarily due to the $400 million of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in April 2022.
Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment is estimated to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million in the second quarter of 2023, and in the range of $255 million to $265 million for the full year 2023.
The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses:
Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher legal and professional fees partially offset by higher interest income.  Interest expense, net was lower in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the prior-year quarter, due to the repayment of the remaining $500 million outstanding under the Corporation's $1.0 billion term loan in February 2022, and capitalized interest that commenced upon sanctioning of the Yellowtail development in Guyana in April 2022.Second quarter 2023 corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $30 million and in the range of $120 million to $130 million for the full year 2023.  Interest expense, net is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the second quarter and in the range of $305 million to $315 million for the full year 2023.
In the first quarter of 2022, results included a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of real property and a charge of $9 million ($9 million after income taxes) for litigation related costs associated with our former downstream business.
Our future results may be impacted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, reserve and production changes, asset sales, impairment charges and exploration expenses, industry cost inflation and/or deflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, the effects of weather, crude oil storage capacity, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk.  For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect our business, see
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources:
The following table summarizes our cash flows:
Operating activities:  Net cash provided by operating activities was $638 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $156 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1,032 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $952 million in the first quarter of 2022.  During the first quarter of 2023, changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced cash flow from operating activities by $394 million primarily due to premiums paid for crude oil hedge contracts and payments for abandonment activities.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2022 reduced cash flow from operating activities by $1,108 million reflecting payments of approximately $470 million for accrued Libyan income tax and royalties at December 31, 2021, premiums paid for crude oil hedge contracts and an increase in accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices.Investing activities:  Additions to property, plant and equipment of $837 million in the first quarter of 2023 were up $291 million compared with the corresponding period in 2022.  The increase is primarily due to higher drilling in the Bakken and development activities in Guyana.
The following table reconciles capital expenditures incurred on an accrual basis to Additions to property, plant and equipment:
Financing activities:  Common stock dividends paid were $137 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $119 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were $131 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $74 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Net borrowings (repayments) of debt with maturities of 90 days or less related to the HESM Opco revolving credit facility, which was used to finance the repurchase of approximately 3.6 million HESM Opco Class B units for $100 million.  In the first quarter of 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1.0 billion term loan.
At March 31, 2023, we had $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $5.4 billion.  We plan to return up to 75% of our annual adjusted free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and adjusted for debt repayments and net Midstream financing activities) to shareholders through dividend increases and common stock repurchases.  In March 2023, we announced a 17% increase in our first quarter dividend on common stock and our Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion.Net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 365,000 boepd to 375,000 boepd, and we expect our 2023 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.7 billion.  In 2023, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment and capital return programs.  Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity for borrowings and letters of credit under committed and uncommitted credit facilities at March 31, 2023:
The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit.  Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.400% above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt.  The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility).  The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%.  As of March 31, 2023, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants.  At March 31, 2023, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facility.All three major credit rating agencies that rate the senior unsecured debt of Hess Corporation have assigned an investment grade credit rating.  In June 2022, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our senior unsecured ratings from Ba1 to Baa3 with a stable outlook.  In March 2023, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed our credit rating at BBB- with stable outlook.  Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB- credit rating with a positive outlook in August 2022. We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.
At March 31, 2023, HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, had $1.4 billion senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $400 million term loan facility.  Borrowings under the term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.650% to 2.550%, while the applicable margin for the syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375% to 2.050%.  Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities).  If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time.  The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions.  At March 31, 2023, borrowings of $121 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s term loan facility.  Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.
We are exposed in the normal course of business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values.  See Note 11, Financial Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $184 million at March 31, 2023 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies.  The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately $20 million, respectively, at March 31, 2023.At March 31, 2023, our long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of $8,387 million and a fair value of $8,460 million.  A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $445 million or $490 million, respectively.  Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.At March 31, 2023, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel for 80,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel for 50,000 bopd.  As of March 31, 2023, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI and Brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our put options would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $55 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $105 million.
