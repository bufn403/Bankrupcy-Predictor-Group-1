Step 1: The management's discussion provides insightful information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company. Despite being classified as an essential business and implementing various safety measures for employees and customers, the company still faced challenges due to the pandemic. The discussion acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in heightened demand for essential goods, leading to changes in consumer behavior and an overall mix shift in product demand.

Step 2: 
- Net Sales: The company experienced a significant increase in net sales during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in net sales reflects a surge in demand for essential goods due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Gross Profit Margin: The gross profit margin increased by 178 basis points to 31.3% in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period. This increase was primarily driven by reduction in markdowns, higher markups, and improved sales in non-consumable categories.

Step 3: The company's financial performance in terms of increased net sales and gross profit margin despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic indicates a level of resilience. However, the discussion also highlights increased payroll expenses, distribution costs, and transportation costs due to the pandemic, which could impact profitability in the long run.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. While the company showed growth in net sales and gross profit margin during the pandemic, the increased costs related to handling the effects of COVID-19, alongside uncertainties about future consumer behavior and economic conditions, suggest a high risk of bankruptcy. These factors, coupled with the potential for continued economic instability, could severely impact the company's financial health in the future.
