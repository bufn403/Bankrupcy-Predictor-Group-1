High Risk

Step 1: Pessimistic sentiment
The management's discussion text indicates significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stating, "The COVID-19 pandemic-related reduction in energy demand and the dramatic decline in commodity prices...continued to cause disruptions and volatility." This, along with the impairment of assets and the uncertainties outlined, reflects a cautious and challenging outlook.

Step 2: Financial ratios analysis
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value (-0.0659) indicates potential liquidity issues where current liabilities exceed current assets, impacting the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Another negative value (-0.1505) suggests that the company's total assets are not efficiently funded by its retained earnings, indicating potential financial strain.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): The EBIT to Total Assets ratio is positive (0.0598), indicating some profitability in relation to total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A moderate value (0.2159) implies that the company's assets generate a reasonable amount of revenue, but it's not exceptionally high.

Step 3: Overall financial health
The combination of negative working capital and retained earnings ratios, along with the challenges highlighted in the management discussion, point towards financial strain. The positive EBIT to Total Assets indicates some profitability, but it may not be sufficient to offset the liquidity and retained earnings concerns.

Step 4: Final Decision
Given the high level of pessimism in the management discussion, coupled with negative working capital and retained earnings ratios, the company's overall financial health seems precarious. Therefore, the company is classified as having a High Risk of bankruptcy in the future.
