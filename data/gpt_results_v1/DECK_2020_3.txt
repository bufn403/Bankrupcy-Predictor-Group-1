1. **Step 1:**

The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. While there are mentions of challenges due to the pandemic, there is a belief that the company's actions, combined with strong brands and a favorable liquidity position, will help them emerge from the pandemic operationally sound and poised for continued long-term growth.

2. **Step 2:**

Observing relevant numbers and figures, the company mentioned that total net sales increased primarily due to higher sales across both wholesale and DTC channels for the UGG brand and HOKA brand. They experienced an 8.8% increase in the total volume of pairs sold. However, there were challenges with lower international wholesale sales for the UGG brand due to marketplace reset strategies in Europe and Asia.

3. **Step 3:**

In determining the quarter's success, the company highlighted that wholesale net sales for both the UGG and HOKA brands increased, mostly driven by expanded market share and strong domestic sales. However, there were challenges with lower international wholesale sales for the UGG brand, attributed to marketplace reset strategies in Europe and Asia. Additionally, while the DTC net sales increased due to higher e-commerce sales, there were lower retail sales due to reduced tourism traffic and pandemic-related store closures.

4. **Step 4:**

Considering the cautiously optimistic sentiment, the increased total net sales, and the positive aspects of higher sales volumes and improved gross margin, the company shows resilience and adaptability during these challenging times. However, the lower international wholesale sales for the UGG brand and challenges in the retail sector due to store closures are red flags indicating potential risks. Based on the provided information, the company is classified as having a **medium** risk of bankruptcy. The mixed performance across different segments and the ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic suggest a level of risk that is not low but also not alarmingly high.
