Step 1: The management's discussion provides a detailed analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. It highlights how the pandemic, including temporary closures of stores and the implementation of health and safety protocols, has significantly affected the company's financial performance. The discussion mentions the closure of stores, changes in consumer behavior, and the unpredictability of the pandemic's scope and impact, creating uncertainties ahead.

Step 2: 
- Net Sales: There is a 28% decrease in net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the same period last year due to temporary store closures. This significant drop in net sales indicates financial strain.
- Operating Cash Flows: While the company generated positive operating cash flows in the third quarter, the need to increase borrowing capacity and issue new long-term debt points to liquidity challenges.
  
Step 3: The management's discussion reveals a challenging financial situation for the company due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant decreases in net sales, the need to increase borrowing capacity, and reduced capital spend, indicate financial distress. The closure of stores, reduction in sales volume, and increased costs due to health and safety protocols collectively create a financially precarious environment.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The sharp decline in net sales, the need for increased borrowing, and reduced capital spend signal financial difficulties for the company. The ongoing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, store closures, and the potential impact on supply chain and consumer demand all point towards a high risk of bankruptcy.
