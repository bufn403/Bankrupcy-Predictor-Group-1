Medium risk

Step 1: The sentiment in the management discussion is predominantly pessimistic. The company highlights the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, resulting in a significant decline in passenger demand, operational challenges, and a net loss of $5.2 billion for the first nine months of 2020. The discussion also mentions various cost-cutting measures, workforce reductions, and uncertainties regarding the future recovery post-pandemic.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): -0.0522 indicates that the company has negative working capital relative to its total assets, which could be a sign of financial strain.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.0538 suggests that the portion of retained earnings in relation to total assets is relatively low, potentially indicating a limited buffer for absorbing losses.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.0725 shows that the company's earnings before interest and taxes relative to total assets are positive but not substantially high.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.7554 demonstrates that the company generates a significant amount of revenue compared to its total assets, which could be a positive indicator of asset utilization.

Step 3: The combination of the negative working capital, relatively low retained earnings, and the significant net loss reported in the financial statements points towards a financially challenging period for the company. While the revenue generation is relatively high, the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry has significantly affected the company's overall financial health.

Step 4: Given the overall pessimistic sentiment in the management discussion, the mix of financial ratios indicating financial strain, and the challenging operational environment due to the pandemic, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The adverse impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and financial performance, along with the significant net losses reported, contribute to this assessment.
