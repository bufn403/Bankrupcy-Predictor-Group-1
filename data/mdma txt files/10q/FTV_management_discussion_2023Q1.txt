Fortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 46% of our sales derived from customers outside the United States in 2022. As a company with global operations, our businesses are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of products, software, and services we offer, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country (except for the United States) on our operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided, and geographies served, we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including their sales, to the extent possible, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of our geographic and industry diversity, we face a variety of opportunities and challenges, including technological development in most of the markets we serve, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, and consolidation of our competitors. We define high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia with the exception of Japan and Australia. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend, in particular, on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments, identify, consummate, and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services, and software, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, attract relevant talent and retain, grow, and empower our talented workforce, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world.
We operate and report our results in three segments, Intelligent Operating Solutions, Precision Technologies, and Advanced Healthcare Solutions, each of which is further described below.  Our Intelligent Operating Solutions segment provides advanced instrumentation, software and services to tens of thousands of customers enabling their mission-critical workflows. These offerings include electrical test & measurement, facility and asset lifecycle software applications, connected worker safety and compliance solutions across a range of vertical end markets, including manufacturing, process industries, healthcare, utilities and power, communications and electronics, among others. Typical users of these safety, productivity and sustainability solutions include electrical engineers, electricians, electronic technicians, EHS professionals, network technicians, facility managers, first-responders, and maintenance professionals.  Our Precision Technologies segment helps solve tough technical challenges to speed breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, from food and beverage production and manufacturing to next-generation electric vehicles and clean energy, as our customers seek new test solutions to enable the electrification and connectivity of everything. Our expertise in materials, methods and measurements are reflected in our electrical test & measurement, sensing and material technologies offered to a broad set of customers and vertical end markets, including industrial, power and energy, automotive, medical equipment, food and beverage, aerospace and defense, semiconductor, and other general industries. Customers for these products and services include design engineers for advanced electronic devices and equipment, process and quality engineers focused on improved process capability and productivity, facility maintenance managers driving increased uptime, and other customers for whom precise measurement, reliability, and compliance are critical in their applications.Our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment supplies critical workflow solutions enabling healthcare providers to deliver exceptional patient care more efficiently. Our offerings include instrument sterilization solutions, instrument tracking, cell therapy equipment design and manufacturing, biomedical test tools, radiation detection and safety monitoring, and end-to-end clinical productivity software and solutions. Our healthcare offerings help ensure critical safety standards are met, instruments and operating rooms are working at peak performance, and complex procedures are followed accurately in these mission-critical healthcare environments.
In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refer to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) the impact from acquired and divested businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition and the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisition and divestiture related items because the nature, size, and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. Management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of long-term performance. References to sales volume from existing businesses refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.
We initiated a discrete plan in the first quarter of 2023 focused on improvements in our operational efficiency, which is expected to be completed by December 31, 2023. The nature of these activities were broadly consistent throughout our segments and consist of targeted workforce reductions and facility consolidations or closures in response to overall macroeconomic and other external conditions. We incurred these costs to position ourselves to provide superior products and services to customers in a cost-efficient manner, while taking into consideration the impact of broad economic uncertainties. The total restructuring charges we expect to recognize under this discrete plan are approximately $25 to $30 million, with charges of $17.6 million incurred in the first quarter, which primarily related to employee severance. These charges are included in Cost of Sales and Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Accrued restructuring costs were $13.4 million as of March 31, 2023 and were included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
During the three month period ended March 31, 2023 (“the quarter” or the “first quarter”) our sales increased by 6.1% from existing businesses, partially offset primarily by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Year-over-year sales from existing businesses increased 8.8%, reflecting continued strong demand across end markets, favorable pricing and focused execution on service and delivery. Geographically, in the first quarter, year-over-year sales from existing businesses in developed markets increased mid-single-digit, with growth driven by mid-single-digit growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Western Europe. Sales from existing businesses in high growth markets increased year-over-year in the first quarter at a high-teens rate, driven by low thirties growth in China and low double-digit growth in Latin America. In addition to increased volumes, year-over-year price increases contributed 4.6% to sales growth during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period in 2022 and is reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. In the first quarter, price increases exceeded inflation impacts on purchased materials.Supply chain issues persisted in the quarter, resulting in lingering challenges with logistics, material availability and absenteeism. We continue to apply the Fortive Business System (“FBS”) to help mitigate the impact of these challenges and to serve our customers. We anticipate that the disruptions which began with the pandemic will continue to impact future periods.
We anticipate revenue growth to be between 1.5% and 3.5% for the second fiscal quarter of 2023, and 3.0% and 4.5% for the full 2023 fiscal year. We anticipate growth from existing businesses to be between 2.5% and 4.5% for the second quarter and 4.0% and 5.5% for the full year. We expect that foreign exchange rates will remain volatile throughout the year and could create unfavorable results relative to foreign exchange rates in 2022. Additionally, this outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks, including but not limited to the resilience and durability of the economies of the United States and other critical regions, ongoing challenges with global logistics and supply chains including the availability of electronic components, inflationary pressures, the impact of the Russia Ukraine Conflict, market conditions in key product segments and elective surgery rates. We will continue to deploy FBS to actively manage production challenges, collaborate with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and utilize price increases and other countermeasures to offset inflationary pressures.We continue to monitor the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which may impact our business, including the lingering societal impact of the pandemic, continued geopolitical conflict, global inflation, potential adverse global economic trends and sentiments, monetary and fiscal policies, including impact on our cost of capital, the stability of U.S. and international banking systems, international trade and relations between the U.S., China and other nations, and investment and taxation policy initiatives being considered in the United States and by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).
The following table summarizes total aggregate year-over-year sales growth and the components thereof for the first quarter as compared to the comparable period of 2022:
Operating profit margin was 16.5% for the quarter, yielding an increase of 110 basis points as compared to 15.4% in the comparable period of 2022. Year-over-year changes in operating profit margin were comprised of the following:•Year-over-year increase in price and sales volumes from existing businesses, which were partially offset by higher employee compensation, investments in R&D, sales and marketing and unfavorable foreign exchange rates — favorable 90 basis points•The year-over-year effect of amortization from existing businesses — favorable 70 basis points•The year-over-year net effect of acquisition-related transaction costs which were lower in the first quarter than those recognized during the comparable period in 2022 — favorable 60 basis points•The year-over-year net effect of acquired and divested businesses, including amortization, and acquisition-related fair value adjustments — favorable 10 basis points•The year-over-year effect of costs relating to the formal restructuring plan in 2023 — unfavorable 120 basis points

Our Precision Technologies segment helps solve tough technical challenges to speed breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, from food and beverage production and manufacturing to next-generation electric vehicles and clean energy, as our customers seek new test solutions to enable the electrification and connectivity of everything. Our expertise in materials, methods and measurements are reflected in our electrical test & measurement, sensing and material technologies offered to a broad set of customers and vertical end markets, including industrial, power and energy, automotive, medical equipment, food and beverage, aerospace and defense, semiconductor, and other general industries.
Year-over-year sales from existing businesses increased 13.7% during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022. The year-over-year results were driven by price increases, strong performance in our test and measurement business, and improved production execution with our energetic materials product line.Geographically, sales from existing businesses in developed markets increased by high single-digits in the quarter, driven by high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in Western Europe. Sales in high growth markets increased by high twenties in the first quarter driven by high thirties growth in China as well as mid-single-digit growth in Other Asia. Year-over-year price increases in our Precision Technologies segment contributed 4.9% to sales growth for the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022, and is reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Operating profit margin increased 190 basis points for the quarter as compared to the comparable period of 2022.

Our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment supplies critical workflow solutions enabling healthcare providers to deliver exceptional patient care more efficiently. Our offerings include instrument sterilization solutions, instrument tracking, cell therapy equipment design and manufacturing, biomedical test tools, radiation detection and safety monitoring, and end-to-end clinical productivity software and solutions. Our healthcare offerings help ensure critical safety standards are met, instruments and operating rooms are working at peak performance, and complex procedures are followed accurately in these mission-critical healthcare environments.
Year-over-year sales from existing businesses increased 0.1% during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022. The year-over-year results in the quarter were driven by price increases and higher software revenue, which were mostly offset by reduced volume for sterilization products in North America and China, supply issues with quality assurance equipment and reduced demand for system design and related services. Geographically in the quarter, sales from existing businesses increased by low single-digit in developed markets driven by slight growth in North America and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. In high growth markets, sales from existing businesses declined by mid-single-digit, driven by a high single-digit decline China. Year-over-year price increases in our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment contributed 2.2% to sales growth during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022, and is reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Operating profit margin decreased 340 basis points during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022. Year-over-year changes in operating profit margin were comprised of the following:•Year-over-year increase in price from existing businesses was offset by reductions in volume, unfavorable product mix, higher employee compensation and material costs, sales and marketing costs and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates — unfavorable 300 basis points•The year-over-year effect of amortization from existing businesses — unfavorable 25 basis points•The year-over-year net effect of acquisition-related transaction costs which were lower in the quarter than those recognized in the comparable period in 2022 — favorable 40 basis points•The year-over-year effect of acquired and divested businesses, including amortization, and acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory — favorable 45 basis points•The year-over-year effect of costs relating to the formal restructuring plan in 2023 — unfavorable 100 basis points
The year-over-year increase in gross profit during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022, is due primarily to year-over-year increases in price and sales volumes, and productivity gains from FBS, partially offset by higher employee compensation costs, the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, unfavorable product mix and restructuring charges.
SG&A increased during the quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022 due to increased employee compensation expenses, customer acquisition and marketing costs and restructuring costs, partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates.On a year-over-year basis, SG&A represented as a percentage of sales, decreased 10 basis points during the first quarter due to leverage on SG&A costs, which grew at a slower rate than our sales. R&D, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, increased slightly during the first quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022 due to ongoing investment in innovation and key initiatives and higher employee compensation costs. On a year-over-year basis, R&D expenses represented as a percentage of sales decreased by 30 basis points in the first quarter given R&D grew at a slower rate than our sales.
For a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated condensed financial statements.Net interest expense for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $19 million in the comparable period in 2022. The year-over-year increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates incurred on floating rate debt instruments, despite overall lower debt balances.
Our effective tax rates for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 was 15.7%, as compared to 13.5%, for the three month period ended April 1, 2022. The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three month period ended April 1, 2022 was primarily due to uncertain tax position reserves released during the three month period ending April 1, 2022. Our effective tax rates for the three month periods ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the impact of credits and deductions provided by law and changes in our uncertain tax position reserves. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other provisions, implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on book income on corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income during the most recently-completed three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion. This provision is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based upon our analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and subsequently released guidance, we believe that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not have a material impact on our financial statements in 2023.
Comprehensive income increased by $61 million during the first quarter as compared to the comparable period in 2022 due primarily to favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of $53 million, and an increase in net income.
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity, which consist of available cash, our revolving credit facility, and access to commercial paper, bank loans, and capital markets, will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, fulfill our contractual obligations, and manage our capital structure on a short and long-term basis. We have generally satisfied any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under our U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper programs (“Commercial Paper Programs”). Credit support for the Commercial Paper Programs is provided by a five-year $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on October 18, 2027 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) which, to the extent not otherwise providing credit support for the commercial paper programs, can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Commercial Paper Programs when we have outstanding borrowings. We expect to limit any future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow, if needed, and repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures. We continue to monitor the financial markets, the stability of U.S and international banks and general global economic conditions. If changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely affect our access to the capital markets and other financing sources, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing available capacity under our credit facilities to provide short-term funding.
Following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity ($ in millions):
Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, interest, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows.  Operating cash flows were $174 million during the quarter, representing a decrease of 40 million, or 19%, as compared to the comparable period of 2022. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors:•Year-over-year increases of $10 million in Operating cash flows from net earnings, net of non-cash items (Amortization, Depreciation, and Stock-based compensation).•The aggregate changes in trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $44 million of cash during the quarter as compared to using $25 million in the comparable period of 2022. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle, which generally represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers, and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate changes in prepaid expenses, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities used $94 million of cash in the year-to-date period as compared to using $63 million of cash in the comparable period of 2022. The year-over-year changes were driven by timing differences related to contract liabilities, tax payments, and employee compensation and benefits.
Cash flows from investing activities, consisting primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions, decreased $7 million during the first quarter, as compared to the comparable period of 2022. The increase in investing cash flows was primarily due to a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures of approximately $6 million.Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing production capacity, replacing aged equipment, supporting product development initiatives for hardware and software offerings, improving information technology systems, and purchasing equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers. For the current year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $90-110 million, although actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayment of debt and commercial paper, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, financing activities used cash of $187 million, reflecting the following transactions:•Incurred $159 million in net commercial paper repayments under the U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program, which had a weighted annual effective rate of 4.98% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 30 days.•Dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $25 million.In the comparable 2022 period, financing activities used cash of $333 million, reflecting the following transaction:•Incurred $931 million in net commercial paper borrowings under the U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program, which had a weighted annual effective rate of 0.91% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 39 days.•Repurchased 1,000,000 shares for approximately $64 million under our share repurchase program.•Made dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $25 million.•On February 15, 2022, the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, Fortive repaid, in cash, $1.2 billion in outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon.Refer to Note 4 of the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness.
As of March 31, 2023, we held approximately $673 million of cash and equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less and yielded insignificant interest income during the first quarter. Approximately 90% of the $673 million in cash and equivalents was held outside of the United States.We have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund our pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, and support other business needs or objectives. With respect to our cash requirements, we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions and repayment of maturing debt, we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs. We also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.Foreign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes. We have made an election regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs, local law restrictions, high foreign remittance costs, previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions, or future growth needs. For most of our foreign operations, we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment. No provisions for foreign remittance taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely. The amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings, unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation, and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings.As of March 31, 2023, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.
There were no material changes during the first quarter to the items we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
