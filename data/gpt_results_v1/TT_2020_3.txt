Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. Despite acknowledging challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the company highlights strong operational performance and cost-cutting actions to mitigate the impacts. For example, they state, "In light of the current economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic, strong operational performance helped mitigate its impacts and increased Net revenues" and "We continue to navigate the new realities brought about by the COVID-19 global pandemic as well as any impact on our liquidity needs and ability to access capital markets."

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided include an increase in net revenues by 0.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and a decrease in net revenues by 6.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, the gross profit margin increased by 70 basis points for the three months and decreased by 30 basis points for the nine months, driven by factors like pricing, cost containment initiatives, and volume impacts from the pandemic.

Step 3: The company mentions that although impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, they took effective measures to manage costs, improve pricing, and maintain productivity. They state, "strong operational performance helped mitigate a challenging first half of 2020" and "the increase was primarily driven by improved pricing, cost containment initiatives and strong productivity."

Step 4: Considering the cautiously optimistic sentiment, the slight increase in net revenues for the recent quarter despite challenges, the positive impact of cost-cutting measures on profitability, and the company's confidence in its sustainability strategy and financial position, the high-risk statement is chosen. The company's ability to navigate the challenges and focus on innovation and growth opportunities amidst the pandemic suggests a level of resilience.
