Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. The company highlights its increased net sales and gross profit, attributing the improvements to various factors like cost synergies from acquisitions and fixed cost leverage. However, it also mentions challenges such as higher input and transportation costs, COVID-19 related expenses, and lost profits from divested businesses.

Step 2: The company reported a diluted earnings per share of $0.77 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, higher than the $0.53 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This is supported by the statement: "Diluted earnings per share were affected by higher net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020."

Step 3: The company's retail segments experienced increased net sales due to higher at-home food consumption amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Foodservice segment faced sales declines due to lower traffic in away-from-home food outlets. The company expects these trends to continue through the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This is evident from the statement: "We expect that these trends will continue through the third quarter of fiscal 2021."

Step 4: Considering the cautiously optimistic tone, the improved earnings per share, and the challenges faced by the Foodservice segment due to the pandemic, the company is deemed to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. The uncertainties surrounding the impact of the pandemic and various charges related to restructuring plans and asset divestitures contribute to this classification.
