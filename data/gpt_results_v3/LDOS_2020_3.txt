Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious due to the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations. While they have taken steps to minimize disruptions and are seeking reimbursement for costs, there is uncertainty regarding the future impact of the outbreak. For example, "The outbreak has impacted each of our groups, primarily in access to customer sites, travel restrictions, limitations of remote work and COVID-19 related costs." Additionally, they mention delays in certain contracts and the potential reduction in margins due to reimbursements under the CARES Act.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1) of 0.0799 indicates a relatively low level of working capital compared to total assets, which may pose a risk in terms of liquidity and short-term financial obligations.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2) of 0.1862 shows that a moderate portion of the total assets is tied up in retained earnings, suggesting stability in the company's financial structure.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3) of 0.0484 indicates a low profitability margin concerning the total assets, which might be a concern for the company's overall financial performance.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5) of 1.2161 is a relatively high ratio, signifying that the company is generating significant revenue in comparison to its total assets.

Step 3: 
Combining the cautionary tone of the management discussion with the financial ratios, the company appears to be facing challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue, profitability, and operational efficiency. While the company is making efforts to mitigate the effects, the lower working capital and profitability margins raise concerns about their financial stability in the short term.

Step 4: 
Considering the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, the lower working capital to total assets ratio, and the challenges in profitability highlighted by EBIT to Total Assets, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The impact of COVID-19, delays in contracts, and uncertainties regarding future reimbursements all contribute to this assessment.
