Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Our financial results and key community metrics for the first quarter of 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $28.65 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis was $29.46 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased 26% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a 17% year-over-year decrease in our average price per ad. We believe that advertising demand during the first quarter of 2023 continued to be impacted by a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.Income from operations for the first quarter of 2023 was $7.23 billion, a decrease of $1.30 billion, or 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2022, due to an increase in cost and expenses, including $1.14 billion restructuring charges, an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, and higher payroll and related expenses. The increase in cost and expenses was partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue.
We report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content.
•Net income was $5.71 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.09 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023.•Effective tax rate was 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.•Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $37.44 billion as of March 31, 2023.•Long-term debt was $9.92 billion as of March 31, 2023.•Headcount was 77,114 as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Substantially all employees impacted by the 2022 layoff are no longer reflected in our reported headcount as of March 31, 2023. Further, the employees that would be impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in our reported headcount as of March 31, 2023.
In 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of our employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects. As of March 31, 2023, we have substantially completed the 2022 employee layoff while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives. We incurred additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $621 million in the first quarter of 2023.In March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the FoA and RL segments. In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $1 billion, of which $523 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2023 and the remaining charges will be substantially recorded by the end of 2023. A summary of our restructuring charges for the three months ended March 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):
(1)    Includes severance and personnel costs of $523 million related to the 2023 layoffs and $18 million reduction in severance estimates related to the 2022 layoff.(2)    Relates to a change in estimates in our data center restructuring charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022.Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $934 million and RL segment were $210 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These charges lowered our operating margin by four percentage points and diluted EPS by $0.44. We expect to incur total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $3 billion to $5 billion during the full-year 2023, of which $1.14 billion was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023.
•Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.02 billion on average for March 2023, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.81 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.04 billion on average for March 2023, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.99 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of 2% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in the first quarter of 2023 increased by 26% year-over-year, and the average price per ad in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 17% year-over-year.
Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Directive, and California Privacy Rights Act have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.
Other global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in the first quarter of 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.
We expect our total expenses in 2023 to be driven by headcount-related expenses and investments in our data center capacity, servers, and network infrastructure. The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, and develop new product features using generative AI. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. Our RL segment reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately $13.72 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase in 2023 and beyond. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.
The numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our "Family" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Worldwide DAP increased 5% to 3.02 billion on average during March 2023 from 2.87 billion during March 2022.•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
As of March 31, 2023, we had 3.81 billion MAP, an increase of 5% from 3.64 billion as of March 31, 2022.•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.
During the first quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPP was $7.59, a decrease of 2% from the first quarter of 2022.
The numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.•Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.
Worldwide DAUs increased 4% to 2.04 billion on average during March 2023 from 1.96 billion during March 2022. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during March 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.
As of March 31, 2023, we had 2.99 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from March 31, 2022. Users in India, Nigeria, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in the first quarter of 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.
We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See "Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in the first quarter of 2023 in the United States & Canada region was more than 10 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the first quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPU was $9.62, an increase of 1% from the first quarter of 2022. Over this period, ARPU increased by 7% in Rest of World and by 1% in Europe, United States & Canada, and Asia-Pacific. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Rest of World and Asia-Pacific. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.
Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are monetized at a lower rate than our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.
RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.
Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses, which include share-based compensation, for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.
The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (in millions):
The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1):
(1)    Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.
The following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment:
FoA revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.09 billion, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by advertising revenue.
Advertising revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.10 billion, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022 due to an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the number of ads delivered increased by 26% year-over-year as compared with an increase of 15% in the same period in 2022. Ad impressions grew in all regions during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in ads delivered during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the average price per ad decreased by 17% year-over-year, as compared with a decrease of 8% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products such as video and Reels that monetize at lower rates, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, and lower advertising demand, which we believe continued to be impacted by a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors discussed in the section entitled "—Executive Overview of First Quarter Results." In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth was driven mostly by marketer spending in the online commerce, healthcare, and entertainment and media industries. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.
RL revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $356 million, or 51%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in RL revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.
The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $29.46 billion and $28.91 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $816 million and $806 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.
Cost of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $103 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in RL inventory cost and a $168 million reduction of data center restructuring charges recorded in 2022.
Research and development expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.67 billion, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was partly due to restructuring charges related to facilities consolidation and severance and other personnel costs. In addition, higher payroll and related expenses, including an increase in share-based compensation expense in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in RL and FoA, also contributed to the increase.
Marketing and sales expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $268 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses. Our payroll and related expenses decreased as a result of a 13% decrease in employee headcount from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 in our marketing and sales functions.
General and administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $525 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in restructuring charges, related to severance and other personnel costs and facilities consolidation, as well as higher legal-related costs.
The following table sets forth income (loss) from operations by segment:
FoA income from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $265 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was driven by higher cost and expenses in FoA, primarily due to increases in restructuring charges and operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure. These were partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue.
RL loss from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.03 billion, or 35%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in loss from operations was driven by increases in cost and expenses, mostly due to payroll and related expenses as well as restructuring charges, and by a decrease in RL revenue due to lower volume of Meta Quest sales.
Interest and other income, net in the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $304 million, or 79%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in other income, net was related to a decrease in unrealized gains recognized for our equity investments.
Our provision for income taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $155 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2022, due to an increase in the effective tax rate, partially offset by a decrease in income before provision for income taxes.Our effective tax rate increased in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, an increase in tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation, and a decrease in tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income in proportion to income before provision for income taxes.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the April 21, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2023 to be around 20%. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions subject to the strictest regulations and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $37.44 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.30 billion from December 31, 2022. A majority of the decrease was due to $9.36 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $7.09 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases. These decreases were partially offset by $14.0 billion of cash generated from operations. Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 56 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $9.22 billion, including $77 million related to the 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of March 31, 2023, $41.73 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $3.05 billion of share-based compensation expense, $2.52 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, and $2.36 billion of changes in working capital. Cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023, decreased by $78 million compared to the same period in 2022.
Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 mostly consisted of $6.82 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $449 million proceeds from net maturities and purchases of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a decrease in net proceeds from sales and purchases of marketable debt securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.
Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 mostly consisted of $9.36 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $1.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.
We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.
Our operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs.
In August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued in four series, which mature from 2027 through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of March 31, 2023 are $404 million and $7.49 billion, respectively. Net proceeds from the offering are used for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.
As of March 31, 2023, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $361 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $5.72 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2023. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.
We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
