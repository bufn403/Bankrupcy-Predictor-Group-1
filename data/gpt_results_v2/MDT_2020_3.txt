Decision: Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and slightly pessimistic due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. The statement, "COVID-19 is having, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on significant aspects of our Company and business," reflects this sentiment.

Step 2: Relevant numbers indicate a decline in net sales for various segments due to the pandemic. For example, the statement, "The decrease in net sales...was primarily attributable to the impact of COVID-19," highlights the financial challenges faced by the company.

Step 3: The conditions are likely to improve gradually as indicated by the statement, "Procedure volumes continued to recover in multiple markets around the world during the second quarter," suggesting a potential recovery from the depths experienced earlier in the pandemic. However, uncertainties remain regarding the future impact of COVID-19 on the business.

Final decision: Considering the cautious sentiment, the decline in net sales, and the uncertain outlook due to the ongoing pandemic challenges, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The recovery seen in some areas indicates some resilience, but the overall environment remains challenging.
