High

Step 1: The management's discussion does not convey an optimistic sentiment as it outlines various risks and uncertainties the company faces, including those related to operating factors, market and industry factors, government factors, global factors, and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The mention of risk factors regarding the company's operations and external environment suggests a cautious and realistic tone.

Step 2: The discussion of financial figures and projections includes positive aspects such as an increase in total revenues by 39.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. There are also mentions of lease escalations, high occupancy rates, and successful leasing activities. However, the filing also discloses a loss on early extinguishment of debt and provides details of investment activities with realized gains and losses, showing a mixed financial performance.

Step 3: Despite the positive revenue growth and leasing activities, there are underlying concerns about debt refinancing losses and uncertainties related to investment income with realized gains and unrealized losses. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the real estate market is highlighted, indicating potential challenges ahead.

Therefore, based on the overall discussion of risks, mixed financial performance, and uncertainties, the company is deemed to have a high risk of bankruptcy in the future.

The mention of risks: "A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements," and "adverse developments concerning the life science, technology, and agtech industries and/or our tenants." These indicate potential future challenges influencing the bankruptcy risk assessment.

The details of financial performance: "Total revenues: $545.0 million, up 39.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020," suggest positive growth. However, the disclosure of "loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50.8 million" raises concerns about the company's financial health.

The impact of COVID-19 and economic projections: The filing discusses the severe impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the IMF's projection of a deep global recession. This external risk factor, combined with uncertainties regarding future economic conditions, contributes to the assessment of high bankruptcy risk.
