Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious or pessimistic due to mentions of decreased net income, loss on derivatives, and decreased sales volumes.

Step 2: The company reported a significant increase in net loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Additionally, they recognized a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, impacting their financial performance negatively.

Step 3: The decrease in sales of natural gas, NGLs, and oil for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was primarily due to lower average realized prices and lower sales volumes. The company also highlighted strategic production curtailments affecting their sales volumes.

Step 4: Taking into account the cautious sentiment of the management, the increased net loss, losses on derivatives, and decreased sales volumes, the company appears to be at medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The challenging external environment with the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price war further adds to the uncertainty and risk factors for the company's financial stability.
