Final Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is cautious and focused on the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They mention, "COVID-19 Events are also impacting our operations, and the full impacts of COVID-19 Events on our fiscal year 2020 financial results and beyond are uncertain." This shows a level of concern regarding the ongoing situation.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): A negative value indicates potential liquidity issues, as the company may have more short-term obligations than assets readily available to cover them.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): A value of 0.42 implies that a significant portion of the company's assets are financed by retained earnings, which is a positive sign for financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): This ratio of 0.08 shows that the company is generating a moderate amount of earnings given its total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): A value greater than 1 indicates that the company is generating more revenue than the total assets it holds, which can be a positive indicator.

Step 3: The cautious tone in the management discussion, coupled with the negative working capital ratio, indicates potential liquidity concerns. However, the reliance on retained earnings for financing and the revenue generation compared to total assets provide some stability. The impact of the ongoing pandemic is a significant factor affecting their financial performance.

Step 4: Overall, considering the financial ratios and the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, the company is classified as medium risk. The negative working capital ratio and uncertainties related to COVID-19 contribute to this assessment, but the reliance on retained earnings and revenue generation offer some level of stability.
