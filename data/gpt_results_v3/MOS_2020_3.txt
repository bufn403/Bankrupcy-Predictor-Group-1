Decision: Medium

Step 1: The sentiment from the management's discussion appears to be a mix of challenges and strategies to address them. While there are mentions of unfavorable impacts on results, there are also efforts highlighted to mitigate risks and improve operations. For example, the text mentions, "We continue to execute well and drive toward our 2021 operational targets." This indicates a proactive approach to addressing issues.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.038 indicates a relatively low ratio, suggesting potential liquidity challenges.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.618 shows a strong proportion of retained earnings to total assets, indicating a healthy capital base.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.066 represents a modest return on assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.595 indicates a significant portion of total assets being utilized in generating revenue.

Step 3: When combining the sentiment from the text with the financial ratios, it appears that the company is addressing challenges but still faces some financial risks. The profitability ratios (EBIT to Total Assets) and (Total Revenue to Total Assets) show a decent performance in utilizing assets for generating earnings and revenue. However, the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio indicates potential liquidity issues, which could pose a challenge in the short term.

Step 4: Considering the overall findings, the company is assessed to have a medium risk of bankruptcy. While there are positives such as strong retained earnings and efforts to improve operations, the liquidity challenges indicated by the low Working Capital to Total Assets ratio raise concerns about potential financial stability in the near future. It is essential for the company to address these liquidity issues to mitigate the risk of bankruptcy.
