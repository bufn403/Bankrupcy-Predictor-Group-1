High Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is pessimistic as they highlight the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations. For example, they mention, "Our earnings in the third quarter of 2020 reflect the continued adverse effects of the pandemic. These adverse effects may continue to be significant in the near term."

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided indicate significant decreases in sales revenues and operating income, as well as increases in impairment charges. For instance, they state, "Sales and other operating revenues for the third quarter and nine-month period of 2020 decreased 41% and 39%, respectively," and "Impairments increased $287 million and $3,290 million in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2020, respectively."

Step 3: The numbers suggest a failed quarter with considerable losses and impairment charges. The statement, "Results from our Refining segment decreased $2,759 million and $6,683 million in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2020, respectively," imply a challenging financial situation that may not improve in the near future.

Step 4: Considering the pessimistic sentiment, significant decreases in revenues, and substantial impairment charges, along with the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic's economic consequences, the company appears to be at a high risk of bankruptcy in the future. The continuous adverse effects on earnings and the challenging business environment reinforce this assessment.
