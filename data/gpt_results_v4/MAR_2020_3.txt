Step 1: The management's discussion reflects a cautious and realistic sentiment regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their business. The discussion focuses extensively on the detrimental effects of the pandemic on the company's operations, revenue streams, and global market conditions, with uncertainties about the pace of recovery post-pandemic.

Step 2:
- Revenue Impact: The company experienced significant decreases in revenue, especially due to lower RevPAR, reduced property operations, and lower fee revenues, reflecting the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the travel industry.
- Expense Management: The company implemented cost reduction measures, including furloughs, reduced work schedules, and voluntary transition programs to mitigate the financial impacts of the pandemic. The increase in restructuring and merger-related charges also indicates significant strategic adjustments to navigate the crisis.

Step 3: The financial results show a substantial decline in profits across different business segments due to lower revenue streams and increased expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's operations were severely impacted, with declines in key financial indicators like gross fee revenues, owned and leased revenue, and equity earnings.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The company's extensive discussion on the ongoing and anticipated adverse impacts of COVID-19, substantial revenue declines, and strategic cost-cutting measures suggest a precarious financial position. The proactive steps taken to mitigate the pandemic's effects may not be sufficient to offset the significant losses incurred, posing a high risk of bankruptcy in the near future.
