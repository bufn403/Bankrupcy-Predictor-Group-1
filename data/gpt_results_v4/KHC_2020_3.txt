Step 1: The management's discussion indicates mixed sentiments regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the company's performance. While there was a beneficial impact on consolidated net sales due to increased demand for retail products offsetting declines in foodservice business, there is uncertainty about the sustainability of this trend. The continuous evolution of the pandemic and its effects on consumer behavior leave the long-term impacts on financial condition uncertain.

Step 2:
- Organic Net Sales increased, driven by higher pricing and favorable volume/mix due to increased at-home consumption.
- Adjusted EBITDA grew due to the growth in at-home consumption, overcoming higher expenses and unfavorable currency impacts.

Step 3: The company experienced some positive growth in Organic Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to increased demand for at-home consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of this growth and the potential negative impacts if consumer behavior shifts creates some level of risk. The impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets also indicate underlying weaknesses in the company's financial health.

Step 4: While the company showed resilience and growth during a challenging period, the uncertainties caused by the pandemic and the impairment losses suggest a level of financial instability. The downgrades in credit ratings could impact the company's ability to access markets and increase interest costs, adding to the risk. Therefore, based on the mixed performance and potential challenges ahead, the company is categorized as having a medium risk of bankruptcy.
