Step 1: The management's discussion indicates the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations across its various properties due to reduced visitation and operational restrictions. Despite the significant decrease in net revenues and operating income, the company emphasizes its strong balance sheet, sufficient liquidity, and cost reduction programs to manage through the challenging environment.

Step 2:
- Net revenues decreased substantially across various operating segments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2020, decreased significantly by 82.0% compared to the same period in 2019.
- Operating expenses also decreased notably during the same period, primarily driven by lower casino, general and administrative, and food and beverage expenses as a result of cost reduction programs implemented by management.

Step 3: The company experienced a sharp decline in net revenues and operating income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to significant cost reduction measures and efforts to maintain liquidity. Despite the challenges, the company's focus on managing costs, maintaining staffing levels, and implementing payroll cost-saving initiatives demonstrates resilience in navigating through the adverse operating environment.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. The company's strategic actions to preserve liquidity, manage costs, and maintain operational stability during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate a proactive approach to withstand the challenges. The company's strong balance sheet and liquidity position, alongside the cost reduction measures, suggest a lower risk of bankruptcy, despite the adverse impact on financial performance caused by the pandemic.
