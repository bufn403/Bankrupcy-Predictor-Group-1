High

Step 1: The management's discussion mentions good financial highlights for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2021, including an increase in net revenues, operating income, and income from continuing operations. However, there are points that suggest caution such as decreased net revenues in certain areas and a decrease in net income and net income per share due to higher losses from discontinued operations.

Step 2: 
- Operating Income Increase: Operating income increased primarily due to cost reduction programs, indicating proactive measures to counter challenges.
- Loss from Discontinued Operations: The company incurred a loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2021, which is a negative financial indicator.

Step 3: The financial highlights for the period suggest a mixed performance with improvements in some areas and declines in others. The precautions taken against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate awareness of potential risks, but the losses from discontinued operations and other financial indicators present challenges.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The cautious tone in the management's discussion, coupled with financial indicators like losses from discontinued operations and decreased net income, points towards a high-risk profile for bankruptcy. The company's financial performance appears to be under pressure, and the uncertainties mentioned regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a challenging road ahead.
