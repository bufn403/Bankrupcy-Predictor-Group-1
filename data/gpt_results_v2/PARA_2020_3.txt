Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment in the management's discussion is cautious due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations. One quote supporting this is "The coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the macroeconomic environment in the United States and globally, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations."

Step 2: The company experienced a decrease in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, with a 9% decrease in revenues. This was mainly due to the effects of COVID-19 on their business, such as lower demand in the advertising market and production shutdowns.

Step 3: The decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, was significant at 26%, reflecting the challenges faced by the company. The impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of the business, such as content licensing revenues and theatrical revenues, has been negative.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment, revenue decline, and significant decrease in operating income, along with uncertainties surrounding the impact of COVID-19 on the business, the company is classified as having a medium risk of bankruptcy in the future. The company's efforts to mitigate losses through streaming services and cost-saving initiatives are positive but may not be sufficient to offset the overall challenges faced.
