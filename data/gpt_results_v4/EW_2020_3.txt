Step 1: The sentiment in the management's discussion is cautiously optimistic. Despite acknowledging the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of the business, the company has demonstrated resilience by responding proactively to manage challenges while ensuring continuous access to their life-saving technologies. They have prioritized supporting clinicians and maintaining operations.

Step 2:
- Net Sales Growth: The company reported an increase in net sales for the first nine months of 2020, primarily driven by growth in TAVR products.
- Diluted Earnings per Share: The increase in diluted earnings per share in the recent quarter was attributed to higher sales growth and reduced spending due to COVID-19.
- Gross Profit Margin: The increase in gross profit margin for the same period was driven by strategic decisions regarding the TAVR portfolio and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by costs associated with COVID-19.

Step 3: Despite the initial drop in procedure volumes related to TAVR and Surgical products due to COVID-19, the company exhibited a recovery in procedure volumes over the following quarters. The resilience in adapting to the changing market conditions, combined with the positive sales growth of TAVR and TMTT products, contributed to the overall increase in net sales and gross profit.

Step 4: Low risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, coupled with continuous innovation, successful product launches, and effective cost management strategies, has positioned them with a stable financial outlook. The increase in net sales, gross profit margin, and diligent monitoring of the impact of COVID-19 on their business indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.
