Step 1: The overall tone of the management's discussion in the 10-Q filing is pessimistic. The filing repeatedly highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's financial performance, indicating challenges ahead. For example, the filing states, "Our sales and earnings in the fiscal second quarter declined as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020." This indicates that the company's financials have worsened.

Step 2: Relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion further support the high risk of bankruptcy. The filing mentions significant declines in key financial metrics compared to the previous year, such as:
- Net sales declined 12%
- Income from operations declined 28%
- Net income declined 31%
- EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures declined 18%

These consistent declines signal financial distress.

Step 3: The filing indicates that the company incurred additional costs due to the pandemic's impact on manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as anticipated ongoing costs. It also mentions challenges in demand for frozen potato products, with certain segments experiencing significant declines. Given the uncertainties and challenges mentioned, it is likely that the conditions may worsen for the company.

Step 4: Considering the pessimistic sentiment, the significant declines in key financial metrics, ongoing and expected costs, and challenges in demand, the company is assessed to have a high risk of bankruptcy. The continuous impact of the pandemic on the company's operations and financials creates a precarious situation that may lead to financial instability and potential bankruptcy.
