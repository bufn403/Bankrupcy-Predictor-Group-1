Medium

Step 1: The management's discussion reflects a mixed sentiment. While there are areas of growth and operational increases mentioned, such as in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments, there are also evident challenges highlighted, like the impact of COVID-19 on the Medical Devices segment and decrease in sales in various regions. The cost-saving initiatives mentioned in the text may indicate an underlying concern over expenses or efficiency.

Step 2:
- In the Consumer Health segment, there is operational growth but a negative currency impact, indicating some level of volatility in international markets.
- The Pharmaceutical segment shows strong operational growth but also mentions lower litigation expenses and cost-saving initiatives, suggesting a need to control expenses.
- Medical Devices segment experienced a significant decline, including operational and currency impacts, and the mention of COVID-19-related costs and idle capacity charges in the costs of products sold.

Step 3: The data indicates areas of growth, particularly in the Pharmaceutical segment, but is also marked by declines, like in the Medical Devices segment due to COVID-19 impacts. The cost-saving initiatives and the need to adapt the supply chain point to potential challenges in maintaining profitability.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. Despite some segments showing growth, the overall mixed performance, highlighted challenges, and cost-saving measures suggest a level of financial strain. The impact of COVID-19 on sales and the need to make significant cost-saving efforts indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy, as the company may be facing difficulties in maintaining financial stability in the current market conditions.
