Step 1: The management discussion outlines the challenges faced by Essex due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented health crisis has caused instability and uncertainty in the market, leading to governmental restrictions that negatively impact profitability. The company has implemented various measures to protect its employees and residents, such as transitioning to remote work, increased cleaning practices, and providing support to residents facing financial hardships. Despite these efforts, the long-term impact remains uncertain, depending on the developments in the pandemic and other factors.

Step 2: 
- Same-Property Revenues decreased by 6.7% to $315.0 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to additional cash concessions, lower average rental rates, and increased delinquencies.
- Total return swap income of $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2020.
- Equity income from co-investments decreased by 30.9% to $15.0 million in the third quarter of 2020.
- Operating expenses, depreciation, and interest expenses have increased, impacting the company's financials negatively.

Step 3: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Essex's financial performance, as seen in the decrease in revenues, increase in delinquencies, and decline in equity income and income from co-investments. The measures taken to support residents and employees suggest the challenges faced in rent collection and property operations due to the outbreak.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Essex's financial occupancy, revenue streams, and increased expenses, coupled with uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the crisis, point towards a high risk of bankruptcy for the company in the future. The significant decrease in revenues and equity income, along with increased expenses, indicate financial strain that may pose challenges to the company's financial stability in the long run.
