Decision: Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion appears to be cautious and reflective of the challenging economic environment. The text mentions, "Many uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts... However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC has been and will likely continue to be significant." This indicates a somewhat pessimistic outlook due to the impact of external factors like COVID-19 on the company's operations.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.139 indicates that the company has a reasonable amount of working capital relative to its total assets, which is a positive sign for short-term liquidity.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.401 shows that the company has a significant portion of its total assets tied up in retained earnings, which signifies stability and profitability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): 0.177 demonstrates that the company is generating a moderate level of earnings before interest and taxes relative to its total assets, indicating operational efficiency.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 1.725 suggests that the company is efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

Step 3: The financial ratios show a mixed picture. While the company has good liquidity (X1) and profitability (X2), the relatively lower EBIT (X3) raises concerns about the company's operational performance. Despite efficient revenue generation (X5), the cautionary tone in the management discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 signifies challenges ahead for the company.

Step 4: Considering the cautious sentiment in the management discussion, along with the mixed financial ratios, it is prudent to classify the company as having a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's good liquidity and profitability are positive factors, but the challenges highlighted in the text and the EBIT ratio raise concerns about future financial stability. The company may need to navigate carefully through the ongoing economic uncertainties to mitigate risks effectively.
