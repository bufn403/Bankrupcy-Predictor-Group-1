Final Decision: Medium Risk

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion is mixed. While there are mentions of challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it had on the company's operations, there is also a focus on strategic actions being taken to address the situation. For example, "The Company believes it has the experience and resources necessary to capitalize on opportunities that will arise as employees return to work around the world and macroeconomic conditions improve."

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): 0.181 indicates that the company may have a limited buffer to cover its short-term obligations with its current assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): 0.514 suggests that a significant portion of the company's total assets is financed by retained earnings.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): -0.020 reflects a negative return on assets, indicating financial inefficiency.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): 0.821 shows that the company generates a high level of revenue relative to its total assets.

Step 3: Combining the sentiment analysis with the financial ratios, it can be inferred that while the company is facing operational challenges due to the pandemic, it has taken measures to mitigate risks. However, the financial ratios indicate that there are concerns regarding working capital, profitability, and financial efficiency. The company's ability to generate revenue remains strong, but the negative return on assets is a red flag.

Step 4: Taking into account the mixed sentiment, varying financial ratios, and the company's strategies to navigate the current crisis, the company is classified as having a Medium Risk of bankruptcy. While there are elements of strength, such as revenue generation, there are also significant financial efficiency concerns and challenges related to working capital that warrant caution.
