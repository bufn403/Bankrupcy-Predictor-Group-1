United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "UAL" or the "Company") is a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "United").This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of UAL and United, including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL's revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures, and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words "we," "our," "us," and the "Company" in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.Our shared purpose is "Connecting People. Uniting the World." We have the most comprehensive route network among North American carriers, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations, which utilize jet aircraft with at least 126 seats, and regional operations, which utilize smaller aircraft that are operated under contract by United Express carriers. The Company serves virtually every major market around the world, either directly or through participation in Star Alliance®, the world's largest airline alliance.Our current expectations described below are forward-looking statements and our actual results and timing may vary materially based on various factors that include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "Economic and Market Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information" and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the "2022 Form 10-K"). The Company discusses certain non-GAAP forward-looking projections and is unable to predict certain items contained in the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts; refer to "Supplemental Information" below for further details. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. We, like other companies in our industry, have been subject to these and other industry-specific competitive dynamics. In addition, our operations, supply chain, partners and suppliers have been subject to various global macroeconomic factors. We expect to continue to remain vulnerable to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the execution risks associated with our United Next plan; the impact on the Company of significant operational challenges by third parties on which we rely; rising inflationary pressures; labor market and supply chain constraints and related costs affecting us and our partners; volatile fuel prices; aircraft delivery delays; the lasting effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions, which we believe will change how our customers fly in ways that we expect to be both positive and negative for the Company, including the lingering impact of the pandemic on the return of business and international travel demand—especially in our China market—to pre-COVID-19 levels; the closure of our flying airspace and termination of other operations due to regional conflicts, including the continuation of the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as well as third-party general sales agent services in Russia as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and an escalation of the broader economic consequences of the conflict beyond their current scope; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, including an economic downturn leading to a decrease in demand for air travel or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may impact international travel demand. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition and future results of operations, which are dependent on future developments, including as a result of those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the 2022 Form 10-K. Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility and our growth plans may be delayed, particularly in the short term, due to the impact of the above factors and trends. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, we believe that the expected long-term increase in travel demand will offset increased costs and that the expected operational challenges can be managed in a manner that will allow us to support increased demand.
The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in 2022.
The Company recorded a net loss of $194 million for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to a net loss of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Significant components of the Company's operating results for the three months ended March 31 are as follows (in millions, except percentage changes):
Certain consolidated statistical information for the Company's operations for the three months ended March 31 is as follows:
The table below shows year-over-year comparisons by type of operating revenue for the three months ended March 31 (in millions, except for percentage changes):
The table below presents selected first quarter passenger revenue and operating data, broken out by geographic region, expressed as year-over-year changes:
Passenger revenue increased $3.9 billion, or 61.8%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in capacity of 23.4% as well as strength in both yield and passenger load factor.Cargo revenue decreased $229 million, or 36.5%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower yields and lower tonnage as a result of increased market capacity and rate pressures.Other operating revenue increased $166 million, or 28.1%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in mileage revenue from non-airline partners, including credit card spending and new credit card member acquisitions with the co-branded credit card partner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as well as an increase in the purchases of United Club memberships and one-time lounge passes.
The table below includes data related to the Company's operating expenses for the three months ended March 31 (in millions, except for percentage changes):
Salaries and related costs increased $535 million, or 19.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a 10.2% increase in headcount, an increase in volume-driven pay from increased flight activity and accruals for pay rate increases related to a potential new collective bargaining agreement with employees represented by the Air Line Pilots Association.Aircraft fuel expense increased by $944 million, or 42.3%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, due to both a higher average price per gallon of fuel and increased consumption from higher flight activity.The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the year-ago period (in millions, except percentage change and per gallon data):
Landing fees and other rent increased $105 million, or 17.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increased flying driving higher landed weight volume and higher number of enplaned passengers.Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $295 million, or 72.5%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increased flight activity and increased volumes of both engine overhauls and airframe heavy maintenance checks.Depreciation expense increased $44 million, or 7.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to new aircraft inducted into service.Regional capacity purchase increased $50 million, or 8.8%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period despite an 18.3% regional capacity reduction primarily due to rate increases under various capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers.Distribution expenses increased $177 million, or 78.3%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher credit card fees, agency commissions and global distribution fees driven by the overall increase in passenger revenue. Distribution expenses were also impacted by a higher proportion of business travel as compared to leisure travel, which can result in higher cost distribution channels and forms of payment.
Details of the Company's special charges (credits) include the following for the three months ended March 31 (in millions):
See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on the Company's special charges (credits).Other operating expenses increased $363 million, or 25.0%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year ago period, primarily due to increases in ground handling, passenger services, food and beverage offerings, navigation fees and personnel-related costs as a direct result of the increase in flight activity and inflationary pressures and higher expenditures on information technology projects and services.
The table below shows year-over-year comparisons of the Company's nonoperating income (expense) for the three months ended March 31 (in millions, except for percentage changes):
Interest expense increased $62 million, or 14.6%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher interest rates on variable rate debt.Interest income increased $165 million in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher short-term investments in U.S. government and agency notes as well as higher interest rates.Unrealized gains on investments, net, was $24 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities. See Note 6 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to these equity investments.Income Taxes. See Note 4 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to income taxes.
As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $17.2 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our anticipated access to the capital markets and projected cash from operations. We regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements (including in connection with our capital commitments for our firm order aircraft) and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We also regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital structure to ensure financial risks, liquidity access and cost of capital are each managed efficiently.The Company has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") expiring April 21, 2025 (subject to customary extension rights). The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain route authorities and airport slots and gates. No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at March 31, 2023.We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, leases of aircraft, airport and other facilities, and pension funding obligations. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $37.2 billion of debt, finance lease, operating lease and other financial liabilities, including $3.9 billion that will become due in the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of certain new aircraft and related spare engines. Our debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends or repurchase stock. As of March 31, 2023, UAL and United were in compliance with their respective debt covenants. As of March 31, 2023, a substantial portion of the Company's assets, principally aircraft and certain related assets, its loyalty program, certain route authorities and airport slots and gates, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing and other debt instruments.The Company has backstop financing commitments available from certain of its aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions. See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this report for additional information on commitments.As of March 31, 2023, United had firm commitments and options to purchase aircraft from The Boeing Company ("Boeing") and Airbus S.A.S. ("Airbus") as presented in the table below:
The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2033. The amount and timing of the Company's future capital commitments could change to the extent that: (i) the Company and the aircraft manufacturers, with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft, agree to modify the contracts governing those orders; (ii) rights are exercised pursuant to the relevant agreements to modify the timing of deliveries; or (iii) the aircraft manufacturers are unable to deliver in accordance with the terms of those orders. Airbus notified United that eight Airbus A321neo aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, are now expected to deliver in 2024 and ten Airbus A321neo aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2024, as shown in the table above, are now expected to deliver in 2025. Boeing notified United that 37 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, are now expected to deliver in 2024. Also, United estimates that an additional eleven Boeing 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, will deliver in 2024 and 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2024, as shown in table above, will deliver in 2025. Furthermore, Boeing recently notified United that due to a manufacturing process issue relating to certain Boeing 737 MAX fuselages, six Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2023, as shown in the table above, will be delayed. Boeing may inform United that additional Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2023 may be delayed and/or that certain Boeing 737 MAX aircraft currently expected to be delivered in 2023 may deliver in 2024. However, at this time, we do not expect these delays to be extensive or to have a significant impact on our capacity plan for 2023.  The table below summarizes United's commitments as of March 31, 2023, which include aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and non-aircraft capital commitments. Aircraft commitments are based on contractual scheduled aircraft deliveries without any adjustments for the delays communicated by Boeing and Airbus or estimated by United.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended March 31 (in millions):
Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operations increased $1.7 billion in the first three months of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher profitability as improvements in the demand for air travel continued.Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2023 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, which were approximately $1.8 billion and $0.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, aircraft improvements and advance deposits for future aircraft purchases.Financing Activities. Significant financing events in the three months ended March 31, 2023 were as follows:Debt, Finance Lease and Other Financing Liability Principal Payments. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company made payments for debt, finance leases, and other financing liabilities of $0.8 billion.Debt and Other Financing Liabilities Issuances. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, United received and recorded, net of fees, $488 million from aircraft financings.See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:
These credit ratings are below investment grade levels; however, the Company has been able to secure financing with investment grade credit ratings for certain enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs), term loans and secured bond financings. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of future financing for the Company as well as affect the fair market value of existing debt. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.Commitments, Contingencies and Liquidity Matters. As described in the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company's liquidity may be adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, pension funding obligations, reserve requirements associated with credit card processing agreements, guarantees, commitments and contingencies.
See "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2022 Form 10-K.
The Company evaluates its financial performance utilizing various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, including CASM-ex. The Company has provided CASM-ex, a non-GAAP financial measure, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measure that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusting for special charges (credits) is useful to investors because special charges (credits) are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. Management also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as expenses associated with maintenance and ground handling for third parties from CASM, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to the Company's core business. Management also believes that excluding fuel costs from CASM is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. Management also believes that excluding profit sharing from CASM allows investors to better understand and analyze the Company's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry (due to losses, profit sharing was zero for the periods presented below).Because this non-GAAP financial measure is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered superior to, and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, the related GAAP financial measure and may not be the same as or comparable to any similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.Below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure provided in this report (CASM-ex) to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (CASM) for the three months ended March 31 (in cents):

All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation.Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into less favorable aircraft orders, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions, as well as related costs or other issues, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our expectations; the adverse impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events; any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, the technology or systems; increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or arrangement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, including our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our MileagePlus® financing agreements; the impacts of the proposed phase out of the London interbank offer rate; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the 2022 Form 10-K, and under "Economic and Market Factors" in Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC.The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change. For instance, we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity, as needed. As such, our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations.
