Medium

Step 1: The overall sentiment of the management's discussion seems cautious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. While they mention investments and strategic plans, they also highlight the challenges faced, such as decreased sales volumes and potential bad debt expenses.

Step 2: 
- Working Capital to Total Assets (X1): Negative value (-0.0285) indicates potential liquidity issues as working capital is not sufficient to cover total assets.
- Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2): Relatively low value (0.1013) suggests a lower proportion of retained earnings to total assets which may indicate a lower level of financial stability.
- EBIT to Total Assets (X3): Modest value (0.0467) indicates a moderate level of earnings generated from total assets.
- Total Revenue to Total Assets (X5): Moderate value (0.1837) shows a moderate level of revenue generated from total assets.

Step 3: The combination of cautious sentiment in the management discussion, negative working capital to total assets ratio, and modest financial ratios suggests that the company may be facing some financial challenges. The impact of COVID-19 on operations, decreased sales volumes, and potential bad debt expenses further contribute to the assessment of medium risk.

Step 4: Medium

Overall, the cautious sentiment in the management's discussion, along with the negative working capital to total assets ratio and the challenges highlighted in the text, indicate a medium risk of bankruptcy for the company. The financial ratios also point towards some financial instability, contributing to the decision of a medium risk classification.
