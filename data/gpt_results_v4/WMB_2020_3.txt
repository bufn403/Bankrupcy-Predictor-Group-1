High

Step 1: The management's discussion in the filing indicates a significant decrease in net income attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributed to impairments in equity-method investments, impairments of goodwill, and other unfavorable changes in income and expenses. The company mentions impairment of equity investments, impairment of goodwill, and significant negative impacts from COVID-19 on financial markets and commodity prices. These are concerning factors that point towards challenges in the financial performance.

Step 2: 
- Net income (loss) decrease: The filing highlights that the net income attributable to the company decreased by $631 million due to impairments of equity-method investments and goodwill, along with unfavorable changes in other income, service revenues, equity earnings, and provision for income taxes. 
- Impairment of equity investments: The company recognized $938 million of other-than-temporary impairments of equity-method investments in the first quarter of 2020 due to significant macroeconomic changes impacting energy commodity prices.
  
Step 3: The significant decrease in net income due to impairments, along with the adverse impacts from COVID-19 on financial markets and commodity prices, suggests a failed quarter with substantial financial challenges. The impairments of equity investments and goodwill indicate that the company's investments are not performing as expected, adding financial strain.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The substantial impairments in investments, the significant decrease in net income, and the challenging economic environment due to COVID-19 point towards financial distress for the company. These factors indicate a high risk of bankruptcy, as the company's financial performance seems to be severely impacted by both internal impairments and external economic conditions.
