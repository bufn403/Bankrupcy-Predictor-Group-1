Step 1: The management's discussion outlines the significant adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft on the company's business, revenue, earnings, and liquidity. These challenges are expected to continue to negatively affect the company's financial performance in the future. The extensive disruptions caused by these two factors point to a pessimistic outlook on the company's financial health.

Step 2: The financial indicators presented in the company's discussion demonstrate substantial losses and declines in revenues across various segments. For example, the loss from operations for both the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2020, indicates financial deterioration, especially in the commercial airplane businesses. The decrease in revenues, loss from operations, decreased backlogs, and cancellations of aircraft orders all point to severe financial strain on the company.

Step 3: The financial results show a persistent downward trend in revenues, loss from operations, and backlog reductions, mainly attributed to the challenging market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. The adverse impact on the business's liquidity, earnings, and financial position in 2020 is expected to continue in future quarters, indicating a worsened condition for the company.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The significant financial losses, declining revenues, reduced backlogs, and cancellations of aircraft orders, coupled with ongoing challenges and uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding, suggest a high risk of bankruptcy for the company. The negative financial impacts and the expected continuation of these challenges indicate a precarious financial situation that may lead to insolvency.
