Step 1: The company's management discussion outlines the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, including suspension of truck and engine production and reduced truck deliveries. They also acknowledge increased costs associated with the suspension of production and lower aftermarket parts sales due to the pandemic. While the Parts segment continued to provide aftermarket support and the Financial Services segment offered financing and leasing services during the pandemic, the overall tone is cautious due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's effects on the company's operations.

Step 2: 
- The company experienced a decrease in worldwide net sales and revenues in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower truck revenues, reflecting the challenging market conditions.
- Net income decreased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to lower Truck operating results, indicating financial strain.
- Capital investments and Research and Development (R&D) expenses also decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, which could impact future growth and innovation.

Step 3: The financial results for 2020 show a considerable decline in net sales, net income, and investments compared to the previous year, primarily driven by lower truck revenues. The ongoing impact of the pandemic on operations and financial performance, along with cost-saving measures implemented, suggest a challenging and uncertain outlook for the company. The lower capital investments and R&D expenses may hinder the company's ability to innovate and grow in the future.

Step 4: Medium risk of bankruptcy. The significant decrease in net sales, lower net income, and reduced investments, along with the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, indicate a certain level of financial strain for the company. While the company has taken cost-saving measures and continues to provide essential services, the overall financial performance and outlook suggest a medium level of risk for potential bankruptcy in the foreseeable future.
