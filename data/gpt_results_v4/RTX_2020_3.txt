Step 1: The management's discussion presents a detailed overview of the company's recent restructuring with the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger. Despite detailing the completion of these transactions, it also discusses the significant negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's finances, particularly in the aerospace and defense sectors. The discussion outlines steps taken to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, such as cost-cutting measures, furloughs, and personnel reductions.

Step 2:
- The company highlights significant reductions in fleet utilization, unplanned retirements of aircraft, and cancellations of new aircraft deliveries industry-wide due to the pandemic.
- The company has recorded substantial restructuring charges and impairment of assets due to the negative impacts of COVID-19, such as significant reductions in forecasted revenue leading to EAC adjustments and impairments.

Step 3: The discussion of substantial restructuring charges, impairment of assets, and the ongoing negative impacts on the aerospace industry due to the pandemic indicates a failed quarter with severe financial strain. The company's admission of the need to mitigate costs, significant reductions in capital expenditures, and workforce reductions show the challenging financial position and the urgency to cut expenses.

Step 4: High risk of bankruptcy. The significant impairment charges, ongoing negative impact of COVID-19 on operations, substantial restructuring activities, and impairment of non-goodwill assets demonstrate severe financial distress within the company. These factors, combined with the admission of significant reductions in forecasted revenue and actions to mitigate costs, indicate a high risk of bankruptcy in the foreseeable future.
