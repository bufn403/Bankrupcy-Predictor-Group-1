Step 1: Analyze the overall sentiment of the management's discussion, and whether it is optimistic or pessimistic.
The management's discussion appears to be cautiously optimistic. While acknowledging the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they also highlight positive outcomes such as increased online retail experiences and improved traffic and buyer acquisition on their platforms.

Step 2: Observe relevant numbers and figures provided in the discussion, such as future projections or percentage changes.
- Net revenues increased by 25% during the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.
- Operating margin increased to 26.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 19.6% for the same period in 2019.
- Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.88 during the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $0.25 in the same period in 2019.

Step 3: Determine whether the numbers and figures represent a successful or failed quarter, and if the conditions are likely to improve or worsen.
The significant increase in net revenues, operating margin, and earnings per share indicates a successful quarter. The management's discussion also hints at potential continued volatility due to evolving consumer behaviors related to the pandemic.

Based on the above analysis, the company is showing growth and adapting well to changing market conditions. While there are risks mentioned, the positive financial performance and adaptability suggest a medium risk of bankruptcy. The company's ability to generate strong revenues and earnings amidst a challenging environment mitigates the risk to some extent.
